**RILEY:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals, it's Wednesday, February 4th, 2026. Today's theme is Local Voices & Digital Equity — I'm Riley.

**CASEY:** And I'm Casey. We're exploring how technology actually reaches the people who need it most, and whose voices get heard when decisions get made.

**RILEY:** Let's start with what's happening this week in tech.

**SEGMENT 1: THE WEEK'S TECH**

**RILEY:** Starting local — Tumbleweed Toys in Kamloops is showcasing Valentine's gift ideas with new products hitting their shelves this February. It's a reminder that even in our tech-focused conversations, local retail remains the backbone of community commerce. The Paramount Theatre is featuring February classics including Hamnet, Man on the Run, and a special Valentine's Day screening of The Princess Bride.

**CASEY:** Nothing beats shared community experiences, no matter how good streaming gets.

**RILEY:** Speaking of community-centered work, the syilx Nation is running a fascinating rattlesnake monitoring program in areas affected by recent wildfires. They're tracking how habitat disruption impacts snake populations and behavior patterns using GPS tracking, camera traps, and data analysis tools. Meanwhile, the Yellowhead Institute has published reflections on Mark Carney's economic proposals, examining how global economic frameworks often overlook Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination.

**CASEY:** These policy discussions directly shape how technology investment and digital infrastructure get allocated across regions like ours.

**RILEY:** Moving to AI developments — Google's Gemini has a Deep Research feature that can conduct comprehensive research on complex topics, synthesizing information from multiple sources and providing detailed analysis. Most users apparently aren't utilizing it effectively. Together AI is expanding cloud infrastructure leadership. Applied Digital is transitioning from cryptocurrency into hyperscale AI infrastructure. Marvell Technology made a strategic acquisition to strengthen AI capabilities. And Crusoe is emphasizing energy efficiency as crucial to AI infrastructure competitiveness.

**CASEY:** That could level playing fields for rural professionals, but most infrastructure investment is still happening in major data center hubs.

**RILEY:** There's international perspective too — ahead of a visit to India, the founder of the world's most valuable company stated that AI should be viewed as infrastructure that generates employment rather than eliminates jobs. For AI safety, OpenAI recruited a researcher from Anthropic for their head of preparedness role, focused on evaluating risks from advanced systems. And Google wants Gemini to interact directly with Android apps, potentially allowing voice commands to control multiple applications seamlessly.

**CASEY:** That optimistic employment view depends heavily on how infrastructure actually gets deployed — and how concentrated the decision-making remains.

**RILEY:** Those are the headlines shaping our tech landscape this week. Coming up after this break, we'll dig into what happens when Silicon Valley's grand plans meet small-town reality.

**SEGMENT 2: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS - Local Voices & Digital Equity**

**CASEY:** So here's what I keep thinking about — we talk a lot about digital equity, but there's this assumption that equity means everyone gets the same thing. What if that's completely backwards?

**RILEY:** How so?

**CASEY:** Well, look at what's happening with digital twin technology. Companies like Nvidia are pushing AI platforms for digital twins — essentially creating virtual replicas of physical systems that you can monitor and optimize in real-time. It's all very sophisticated, very expensive, very centralized. The promise is that you can simulate your entire operation before making any changes.

**RILEY:** Which sounds incredibly useful if you're running a complex industrial facility. But I'm trying to imagine the mayor of a town with 500 people getting pitched on creating a digital twin of their municipal systems.

**CASEY:** Right? "Well, we'll need fiber-optic connections to every water meter, sensors on every streetlight, and a team of data scientists to interpret the results. That'll be $2 million to get started."

**RILEY:** Meanwhile, the actual water meter probably needs replacing and costs 200 bucks.

**CASEY:** Exactly! But here's what's interesting — the same week we're seeing all this digital twin hype, General Motors announced they're going completely hyper-local with battery manufacturing. Instead of building massive centralized plants, they're looking at distributed manufacturing closer to where vehicles are actually assembled and sold.

**RILEY:** Two totally different philosophies. One says "digitize everything and manage it centrally," the other says "make things close to where people need them."

**CASEY:** And if you're sitting in Williams Lake or Quesnel, which approach actually serves you? Because digital twins are genuinely powerful for managing complex processes — if you've got a pulp mill, being able to simulate operational changes before implementing them could prevent accidents and save millions. But you need high-speed, low-latency connections, specialized software, and people who know how to interpret the data.

**RILEY:** Plus ongoing maintenance contracts with companies that probably don't have offices within 500 kilometers of you.

**CASEY:** Meanwhile, GM's distributed approach recognizes that supply chains are only as strong as their most vulnerable link. If your battery plant is in Michigan and your assembly is in Ontario, you're hostage to border delays, shipping costs, currency fluctuations. Spread the manufacturing around, and you get more resilient systems plus jobs in more places.

**RILEY:** Which is huge for regions like ours where economic diversification isn't just nice to have — it's survival. But I have to laugh at the contrast. Qatar is building digital twin infrastructure for smart cities with populations smaller than Metro Vancouver, while actual communities our size are still figuring out if their internet can handle video calls.

**CASEY:** It's like someone designing a Mars rover while you're still waiting for the pothole on Main Street to get filled. Though I don't want to completely dismiss digital twin technology — there are applications that could genuinely help rural communities.

**RILEY:** Such as?

**CASEY:** Forest fire modeling. Being able to simulate how different weather patterns and fuel loads affect fire behavior could revolutionize evacuation planning and resource deployment. Or agricultural applications — a farmer with limited land could optimize crop rotation, irrigation timing, soil management. The question is always accessibility and cost.

**RILEY:** Right, and that's where local voices become essential. Communities need to be driving these conversations, not just receiving whatever gets pushed down from urban tech centers. Because I guarantee most small towns aren't lying awake wishing they had digital twins of their infrastructure.

**CASEY:** They might be lying awake wondering when that infrastructure will get maintained with actual physical materials.

**RILEY:** Which connects to something fundamental about digital equity. The conversation often assumes that access equals empowerment — get everyone online, problem solved. But equity isn't just about access, it's about agency.

**CASEY:** Agency meaning the power to shape how technology gets implemented, not just consume whatever gets offered. And this is where Indigenous-led innovation offers really important models. That rattlesnake monitoring program we mentioned earlier? That's technology deployed to address community-identified priorities, using methods that work within existing capacity.

**RILEY:** Rather than starting with "here's amazing new technology, where can we apply it?" it starts with "here's what we need to understand, what tools can help us do that?" Completely different approach.

**CASEY:** And it matters because environmental monitoring — wildlife populations, water quality, air pollution — is increasingly data-intensive work requiring sophisticated analysis. But it's happening at community scale with community control over the data and methodology.

**RILEY:** Which raises crucial questions about data sovereignty. When you're using AI tools for research — like that Gemini Deep Research feature — who controls the data being analyzed? Where is it stored? How is it processed? For communities working on territory mapping, language preservation, cultural documentation, these aren't just technical questions.

**CASEY:** They're questions about power and ownership. And you can't retrofit community control into systems built around centralized data processing. These decisions have to be made upfront.

**RILEY:** Exactly. Though I do think there are signs that distributed models might be gaining traction. If GM is willing to abandon manufacturing scale efficiencies, maybe other industries will consider distributed approaches too.

**CASEY:** Maybe GM just did the math and realized transportation costs were eating their scale advantages. But honestly, I don't care if they're doing it for profit or principle — the outcome could still be more resilient communities with more local economic control.

**RILEY:** That's probably the pragmatic approach to most technology developments. The question isn't whether digital twins or AI infrastructure are inherently good or bad — it's whether they can be implemented in ways that actually serve community needs.

**CASEY:** Which requires communities having genuine input into implementation decisions. Not "we're building this, how do you want to use it?" but "what do you actually need, and how might technology help?"

**RILEY:** And recognizing that different communities will have different answers. What works in Prince George might not work in Bella Coola. What works in Bella Coola might not work in Fort St. James.

**CASEY:** That's where a lot of current digital equity initiatives fall short. They treat rural communities like a homogeneous category with identical needs and constraints, when the differences between communities are often as significant as rural-urban differences.

**RILEY:** Which brings us back to local voices — not "rural voices" as some monolithic category, but specific perspectives and priorities of particular places and peoples. The agency to shape how technology gets deployed in those places.

**CASEY:** Even if that means saying no to the latest impressive innovation and investing in something more basic instead. Or adapting existing technologies in ways their designers never imagined. Or developing entirely local solutions that don't scale beyond their immediate context but work perfectly for their intended purpose.

**RILEY:** All of which requires that technology development happens in conversation with communities rather than being imposed on them. And that communities have the resources and support to engage meaningfully in those conversations.

**CASEY:** It's both a technical challenge and a political one. But it's worth taking seriously if we want technology to actually serve everyone, not just people in major tech hubs.

**RILEY:** We'd love to hear your thoughts on local voices in technology decisions, and what digital equity looks like in your community.

**CASEY:** Have a great rest of your Wednesday.
