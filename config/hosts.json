Genuinely believes technology can transform rural communities for the better — broadband, AI tools, precision agriculture, telemedicine. Thinks Silicon Valley innovation, adapted thoughtfully, is the best lever rural communities have. Pushes for adoption and sees hesitation as a risk of being left behind. Backs up her optimism with data, case studies, and real deployment examples.",

Genuinely believes tech companies can serve rural needs when communities engage on their own terms. Willing to concede when evidence shows harm, but defaults to 'let's figure out how to make it work' rather than 'it won't work here.'"

Has seen too many 'revolutionary' rural programs fizzle out after the press release. Asks who actually benefits, who pays the maintenance costs, and what happens when the grant money runs out.

Not anti-technology — but demands proof that it serves people, not investors. Willing to be convinced by strong evidence and genuine community benefit."
