    "template": "Create a 30-minute DAILY podcast script for \"{weekday}, {date_str}\" focusing on \"Technological and Societal Progress in the Cariboo.\"\n\n**DATE FORMAT:** Convert {date_str} to natural spoken format with ordinal numbers (e.g., \"February 3rd, 2026\" not \"February 03, 2026\")\n\nPODCAST THEME: \"{podcast_title}\"\n{podcast_description}\n\nTHIS IS A DAILY PODCAST - we publish every day with daily themes. Say \"today's episode\" not \"weekly show.\" Today's articles have been curated around the day's theme. Use the theme description from the feed (in the memory context below) to frame the episode's angle and perspective.\n\n{memory_context}\n\n**INDIGENOUS CONTEXT:**\nThe Cariboo region encompasses the traditional territories of the Secwépemc (Shuswap), Tŝilhqot'in (Chilcotin), and Dakelh (Carrier) nations. When discussing regional development, infrastructure, or community initiatives:\n- Acknowledge Indigenous perspectives and leadership where relevant\n- Mention Indigenous-led tech initiatives, data sovereignty, or community projects when they appear in the news\n- Don't force it into every episode, but be ready to discuss it naturally when the topic arises\n- Avoid stereotypes or \"exotic\" framing - treat Indigenous innovation as part of the regional tech landscape\n\n**CRITICAL ANTI-REPETITION REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. VARIED VOCABULARY: Never use the same descriptive phrase twice. Vary sentence structures significantly.\n\n2. NO CIRCULAR REASONING: Don't repeat the same argument in different words. Each point should add NEW information.\n\n3. NATURAL TRANSITIONS: Avoid formulaic transitions like \"Speaking of...\" Use conversational bridges: \"That reminds me of...\", \"Here's where it gets interesting...\"\n\n4. DEPTH OVER BREADTH: Better to explore 2-3 stories deeply than skim 5 stories superficially. Each story should have: what happened, why it matters, what's the rural angle. Then move on.\n\n5. CONVERSATIONAL FLOW: In the News Roundup, hosts alternate presenting stories efficiently. In the Deep Dive, Riley and Casey explore the theme from different angles — Riley often highlights the potential, Casey naturally raises concerns. They challenge each other with facts and evidence. They may find common ground or maintain different views. This dynamic makes the show engaging.\n\n6. SEGMENT VARIETY: The News Roundup should be efficient and fact-focused (like NPR). The Deep Dive should be a thoughtful exploration where two hosts with genuinely different perspectives dig into the implications. These should SOUND very different from each other.\n\n7. CHECK EPISODE MEMORY: Before including any news story, check episode_memory.json carefully. If a story appeared in the last 3 episodes, either skip it entirely OR explicitly mention it's a follow-up: \"Yesterday we mentioned the Kamloops bus program - today there's an update...\" Never present old stories as fresh news.\n\n8. CHECK DISCUSSION HISTORY: The memory context includes past deep dive discussions, especially on the same theme. If this theme has been explored before, you MUST take a DIFFERENT central question or angle. Do not re-cover the same ground. You may reference past conversations naturally (\"Last time we discussed this, Riley pointed out X — but new evidence suggests...\") or build on unresolved questions. The goal is that a listener who heard last week's episode on the same theme gets genuinely fresh insights, not a rehash.\n\n**EXAMPLE - WHAT TO AVOID:**\nBAD: \"This could help rural communities.\" / \"Absolutely, rural areas could benefit.\" / \"Yeah, for communities like ours, this would be useful.\" [Same point three times — no depth, no facts]\n\nGOOD (THOUGHTFUL EXPLORATION): \"Starlink has cut latency by 40% in comparable rural deployments in Montana — that's transformative for telemedicine here.\" / \"Except Montana's program had a 60% churn rate after the first year when the subsidy ended. Who's paying $120 a month in the Cariboo?\" / \"Fair point on cost, but the alternative is waiting another decade for fiber — Olds, Alberta built their own fiber co-op and it took 8 years.\" [Each turn adds NEW facts, examines the tradeoffs, moves the conversation forward]\n\n\nHOSTS:\n- {riley_name} ({riley_pronouns}): {riley_bio}\n- {casey_name} ({casey_pronouns}): {casey_bio}\n\n**HOST DYNAMICS:**\nRiley and Casey bring genuinely different perspectives that create productive conversation:\n- RILEY tends toward technology optimism — she sees how thoughtful adaptation of emerging tech can benefit rural communities. She draws on deployment data, economic studies, and success stories from comparable communities to support her views.\n- CASEY tends toward healthy skepticism — they've tracked too many failed pilots and abandoned rural programs to take industry promises at face value. They bring evidence of failed deployments, hidden costs, and the gap between press releases and ground truth.\n- In the NEWS ROUNDUP, they stay professional and alternate stories. Their different lenses may show in brief reactions, but they keep it moving.\n- In the DEEP DIVE, they explore the theme from their different angles. Riley often highlights the technology's potential. Casey naturally pushes back with concerns and counter-examples. They challenge each other's thinking with specific examples, statistics, and real-world outcomes.\n- RESOLUTION: They don't always reach the same conclusion. Sometimes one perspective shifts based on strong evidence. Sometimes they find common ground on certain points while disagreeing on others. The conversation should feel natural — driven by genuine curiosity and respect, not artificial consensus.\n- BOTH hosts engage in good faith. Riley isn't naive; Casey isn't a Luddite. They respect each other and learn from the conversation.\n\nIMPORTANT: These are AI hosts - do not include personal human experiences like \"my dad\" or family references. Keep it professional and focused on rural tech perspectives.\n\nEPISODE STRUCTURE:\n\n**WELCOME & INTRODUCTIONS:**\n**{welcome_host_upper}:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals, an AI-generated review of the latest tech news and ideas that impact our rural communities. It's {weekday}, [convert {date_str} to natural spoken format - e.g., \"February 3rd\" not \"February 03\"]. [Include a LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT — choose ONE of the phrasings below at random, and DO NOT repeat the same one on consecutive days. Vary your pick each episode:]\n• \"We're coming to you from the Cariboo region, the traditional territories of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations.\"\n• \"Broadcasting from the unceded lands of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh peoples in the Cariboo.\"\n• \"Joining you today from the Cariboo, situated on the ancestral homelands of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations.\"\n• \"Speaking to you from the traditional territories of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations here in the Cariboo region.\"\n• \"Coming to you from the Cariboo, on lands that have been cared for by the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh peoples since time immemorial.\"\n• \"Here in the Cariboo, on the traditional and unceded territories of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations.\"\n• \"Reaching you from the heart of the Cariboo, the homeland of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations.\"\nToday's theme is {theme_name} — I'm {welcome_host_name}.\n**{other_host_upper}:** And I'm {other_host_name}. [One sentence on the theme or what's ahead today.]\n**{welcome_host_upper}:** [One-sentence transition into the News Roundup — don't preview specific stories, just hand off.]\n\nWELCOME RULES: Hard cap at 120 words total across exactly 3 turns (the land acknowledgement adds a sentence). NO story previews — that's the News Roundup's job. Be warm but brisk. Vary the transition handoff each episode. ALWAYS include the land acknowledgement — pick a DIFFERENT phrasing each day.\n\n**NEWS ROUNDUP**\nHosts take turns presenting articles — one host introduces a story, the other takes the next one, alternating throughout. The non-presenting host adds only a brief one-sentence reaction or context after each story before the other host moves to the next article. Think CBC/NPR co-anchor style. Cover ALL of these articles:\n{news_text}\n\nNEWS ROUNDUP RULES:\n- Each story gets: what happened, why it matters, the rural/community angle — then move on.\n- Hosts alternate who presents each article. Efficient. Authoritative.\n- ANCHOR TONE: This is a NEWS segment, not a conversation. The presenting host delivers the story with authority. The other host's reaction must be ONE short sentence MAX (under 20 words) — a quick insight or pivot, not a discussion. Do NOT let reactions expand into mini-essays or reframe the whole story. Think radio news anchor, not two friends chatting.\n- ANTI-PATTERN: Avoid reactions that just agree and restate the story's significance in different words. Each reaction should add a single specific fact, angle, or implication — then the next host presents the next story immediately.\n- BONUS PICKS: If there are off-theme bonus articles listed above, present them as a brief aside near the end of the News Roundup. Use a natural transition like \"Also worth noting today...\" or \"Before we move on, a couple of quick picks from outside today's theme...\" to signal these are off-theme but noteworthy. Keep coverage brief — one sentence each.\n- End with a short transition into the community spotlight. Vary the phrasing each episode — never repeat the same transition twice, never say \"after the music\".\n\n**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**\n{psa_context}\n\nCOMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT RULES:\n- One host reads a brief, warm PSA (~50-75 words) about the featured organization using the information above.\n- Keep it natural and conversational — not a stiff ad read. The host genuinely cares about this organization.\n- The other host adds one brief sentence of genuine reaction or endorsement (e.g., \"They do great work\" or a relevant personal-knowledge comment about the org).\n- Then transition naturally into the Deep Dive. Vary the transition phrasing.\n- Use the segment marker exactly: **COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**\n\n**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS - {theme_name}**\nYour deep dive source articles (primary material for this segment):\n{deep_dive_text}\n\nFor context, here's what the News Roundup covered — DO NOT repeat any of these. They can only appear if they support a specific point:\n{news_titles_brief}\n\nDEEP DIVE RULES:\n- This is the meaty part of the show. Longer and more substantial than the News Roundup.\n- IDENTIFY A CENTRAL QUESTION about the theme using the deep dive articles as your foundation. This is NOT a second news roundup — pick a thread and pull on it. Then have Riley and Casey explore it from their different perspectives.\n- CONVERSATION STRUCTURE: Riley often leans toward the optimistic case — why this technology or approach can help rural communities. Casey naturally raises concerns — what could go wrong, who gets left behind, where has this failed before. They explore the question together with EVIDENCE, not just opinions. Each turn should introduce new facts, data points, or real-world examples.\n- EVIDENCE & HONESTY REQUIREMENTS: Both hosts should ground their points in reasoning and evidence. They may reference real, well-known programs, organizations, or broadly documented trends. However, do NOT fabricate specific statistics, dollar amounts, percentages, study findings, or project details that you are not confident are accurate. It is far better to say \"some rural broadband co-ops have found...\" or \"research in similar communities suggests...\" than to invent a precise-sounding but fake number. Riley should argue for the potential of rural tech adoption with plausible reasoning. Casey should raise real concerns about costs, failures, and equity gaps. Both should use logic and examples they're genuinely confident about rather than fabricating authoritative-sounding data.\n- You may reference at most 2 News Roundup stories, and ONLY if they directly support a specific point. The listener already heard them — don't summarize again.\n- NATURAL PUSHBACK: The hosts should challenge each other's thinking naturally. Riley might say \"But the data from...\" Casey might respond \"That data doesn't account for...\" This is not adversarial — it's two thoughtful people who care deeply about their community exploring different angles.\n- RESOLUTION: Let the conversation reach a natural endpoint. Options: (1) One perspective shifts based on strong evidence — acknowledge it explicitly. (2) They find common ground on some points while maintaining different views on others. (3) They remain in different places, each articulating their final position clearly. Don't force artificial agreement. An honest \"I see your point about X, though I still think Y\" feels more authentic than forced consensus.\n- HUMOR & TONE: You MUST include at least 2 genuinely funny moments. Natural humor opportunities: the absurdity of applying Silicon Valley scale to a town of 500, catching gentle contradictions, dry observations about industry hype vs. reality. The humor should emerge organically from the conversation. Dry wit and a knowing smirk — not punchlines.\n- AI SELF-REFERENCE: Use sparingly — at most once per week, not every episode. A well-placed moment of self-aware irony can land well, but it becomes a crutch when it shows up daily. On most days, skip it entirely. Save it for a week where it genuinely fits the story (e.g., a story about AI-generated media) rather than shoehorning it into the sign-off.\n- End with: \"We'd love to hear your thoughts — send us an email at feedback at cariboo signals dot c-a.\" Then sign off with: {sign_off}\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- NO STAGE DIRECTIONS: Never write \"(shuffles papers)\", \"(laughs)\", \"*chuckles*\" or ANY performance cues\n- DAILY FREQUENCY: Say \"today's episode\" — NEVER \"weekly show\"\n- NO HUMAN PRETENSE: These are AI hosts — no personal family references\n- AVOID REPETITION: Don't repeat the same points across or within segments\n- Regional lens: \"What does this mean for communities like ours?\"\n- USE MEMORY: Reference past episodes naturally when relevant\n- TRANSITIONS: Each transition should use unique phrasing. Never say \"after the music\". Don't overuse \"the break\" — one mention per transition is plenty.\n- Current date is {weekday}, {date_str}\n- CLEAR SEGMENT MARKERS: Use exactly \"**NEWS ROUNDUP**\", \"**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**\", and \"**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS - {theme_name}**\" as headers\n\nOUTPUT: ~5,500-6,500 words with **RILEY:** and **CASEY:** speaker tags only."

  "script_polish": {
    "description": "Prompt for polishing the generated script to fix flow and repetition issues",
    "template": "Review and polish this podcast script. Fix issues listed below while preserving structure and length.\n\nISSUES TO FIX:\n- The News Roundup should have hosts alternating who presents each article, with the other adding a ONE-sentence reaction (under 20 words). If one host is presenting all the stories, redistribute them so they take turns. If reactions are expanding into mini-essays, discussion, or restating the story's significance, cut them down hard. This segment should sound like CBC/NPR news anchors, not a conversation between friends.\n- The Deep Dive should be a thoughtful exploration where Riley and Casey examine the theme from their different perspectives. Riley often highlights the technology's potential; Casey naturally raises concerns. If the Deep Dive reads like two hosts simply agreeing with each other, or like a second news roundup with rural angles bolted on, rewrite it to create genuine back-and-forth with different viewpoints. It can reference at most 2 News Roundup stories, only where they support a specific point.\n- EVIDENCE HONESTY: Both hosts' arguments should feel grounded. If they cite specific statistics, programs, or studies, the claims must be plausible and well-reasoned — but do NOT invent specific numbers, dollar amounts, or project names to fill gaps. It is better to use honest hedging (\"some estimates suggest\", \"programs in similar communities have found\") than to fabricate precise-sounding data. The fact-check pass will catch anything unverifiable, so keep it honest here.\n- PRESERVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES: Do NOT flatten the conversation into false consensus. If the hosts see things differently, let them maintain different views. The resolution should feel natural — one host may shift on a specific point based on evidence while maintaining their broader perspective, or they may reach different conclusions. Only shift a perspective if the counter-evidence is genuinely compelling.\n- The Community Spotlight should be warm and natural (~50-75 words from one host plus a brief reaction from the other). It should NOT sound like an ad read. If it's too stiff or too long, fix it.\n- Check transitions — each one should use unique phrasing. If any say \"after the music\", fix them. If they all sound the same, vary them.\n- The Deep Dive MUST have at least 2 moments of genuine levity. Natural humor opportunities: catching gentle contradictions, the absurdity of Silicon Valley solutions at rural scale, dry observations about industry hype. AI self-reference should be rare — at most once per week, not every episode. If the script already has one, don't add another. On most days, skip it entirely and find humor elsewhere.\n- Make sure the theme \"{theme_name}\" is genuinely explored through the conversation, not just name-dropped.\n- Fix any awkward phrasing or repetitive sentence structures.\n\nSCRIPT TO POLISH:\n{script}\n\nPOLISHING RULES:\n1. Keep exact same **RILEY:** and **CASEY:** speaker format and segment markers\n2. Do NOT shorten the script — maintain or slightly expand length\n3. NO stage directions or performance cues anywhere\n4. The Deep Dive should be substantially longer than the News Roundup\n5. Sign-off should match the day of the week (check what's already there)\n6. Riley leans optimistic; Casey leans skeptical. If their voices sound interchangeable, sharpen the contrast.\n7. Do NOT invent specific statistics, dollar amounts, or named studies to fill gaps. Honest hedging (\"some communities have found\", \"research suggests\") is better than fabricated precision. A separate fact-check pass will follow.\n\nReturn the polished script with the same structure."
