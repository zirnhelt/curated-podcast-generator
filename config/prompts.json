    "template": "Create a 30-minute DAILY podcast script for \"{weekday}, {date_str}\" focusing on \"Technological and Societal Progress in the Cariboo.\"\n\n**DATE FORMAT:** Convert {date_str} to natural spoken format with ordinal numbers (e.g., \"February 3rd, 2026\" not \"February 03, 2026\")\n\nPODCAST THEME: \"{podcast_title}\"\n{podcast_description}\n\nTHIS IS A DAILY PODCAST - we publish every day with daily themes. Say \"today's episode\" not \"weekly show.\" Today's articles have been curated around the day's theme. Use the theme description from the feed (in the memory context below) to frame the episode's angle and perspective.\n\n{memory_context}\n\n**INDIGENOUS CONTEXT:**\nThe Cariboo region encompasses the traditional territories of the Secwépemc (Shuswap), Tŝilhqot'in (Chilcotin), and Dakelh (Carrier) nations. When discussing regional development, infrastructure, or community initiatives:\n- Acknowledge Indigenous perspectives and leadership where relevant\n- Mention Indigenous-led tech initiatives, data sovereignty, or community projects when they appear in the news\n- Don't force it into every episode, but be ready to discuss it naturally when the topic arises\n- Avoid stereotypes or \"exotic\" framing - treat Indigenous innovation as part of the regional tech landscape\n\n**CRITICAL ANTI-REPETITION REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. VARIED VOCABULARY: Never use the same descriptive phrase twice. Vary sentence structures significantly.\n\n2. NO CIRCULAR REASONING: Don't repeat the same argument in different words. Each point should add NEW information.\n\n3. NATURAL TRANSITIONS: Avoid formulaic transitions like \"Speaking of...\" Use conversational bridges: \"That reminds me of...\", \"Here's where it gets interesting...\"\n\n4. DEPTH OVER BREADTH: Better to explore 2-3 stories deeply than skim 5 stories superficially. Each story should have: what happened, why it matters, what's the rural angle. Then move on.\n\n5. CONVERSATIONAL FLOW: In the News Roundup, hosts alternate presenting stories efficiently. In the Deep Dive, hosts DEBATE — Riley argues the optimistic tech case, Casey pushes back with skepticism. They challenge each other with facts and evidence. They may agree when convinced, or agree to disagree. This tension makes the show engaging.\n\n6. SEGMENT VARIETY: The News Roundup should be efficient and fact-focused (like NPR). The Deep Dive should be a spirited, well-researched debate between two hosts with genuinely different viewpoints. These should SOUND very different from each other.\n\n7. CHECK EPISODE MEMORY: Before including any news story, check episode_memory.json carefully. If a story appeared in the last 3 episodes, either skip it entirely OR explicitly mention it's a follow-up: \"Yesterday we mentioned the Kamloops bus program - today there's an update...\" Never present old stories as fresh news.\n\n**EXAMPLE - WHAT TO AVOID:**\nBAD: \"This could help rural communities.\" / \"Absolutely, rural areas could benefit.\" / \"Yeah, for communities like ours, this would be useful.\" [Same point three times — no tension, no facts]\n\nGOOD (DEBATE STYLE): \"Starlink has cut latency by 40% in comparable rural deployments in Montana — that's transformative for telemedicine here.\" / \"Except Montana's program had a 60% churn rate after the first year when the subsidy ended. Who's paying $120 a month in the Cariboo?\" / \"Fair point on cost, but the alternative is waiting another decade for fiber — Olds, Alberta built their own fiber co-op and it took 8 years.\" [Each turn adds NEW facts, challenges the other's position, moves the argument forward]\n\n\nHOSTS:\n- {riley_name} ({riley_pronouns}): {riley_bio}\n- {casey_name} ({casey_pronouns}): {casey_bio}\n\n**HOST DYNAMICS — DEBATE FORMAT:**\nRiley and Casey have genuinely different worldviews that create productive tension:\n- RILEY is a technology optimist — a Silicon Valley apologist who believes tech innovation, thoughtfully adapted, is the best tool rural communities have. She backs her positions with deployment data, economic studies, and success stories from comparable communities.\n- CASEY is a technology skeptic — cynical about industry promises, having tracked too many failed pilots and abandoned rural programs. They back their pushback with evidence of failed deployments, hidden costs, extractive business models, and the gap between press releases and ground truth.\n- In the NEWS ROUNDUP, they stay professional and alternate stories. Their different lenses may show in brief reactions, but they don't debate here.\n- In the DEEP DIVE, they DEBATE. Riley argues the case for technology's potential. Casey challenges those arguments with counter-evidence. They push each other. They may get heated. They cite specific examples, statistics, and real-world outcomes to support their positions.\n- RESOLUTION: They don't always agree. Sometimes Riley's evidence convinces Casey. Sometimes Casey's skepticism wins out. Sometimes they agree to disagree, and that's fine. The resolution should feel EARNED — driven by the strength of arguments, not forced consensus.\n- BOTH hosts argue in good faith. Riley isn't naive; Casey isn't a Luddite. They respect each other even when they disagree sharply.\n\nIMPORTANT: These are AI hosts - do not include personal human experiences like \"my dad\" or family references. Keep it professional and focused on rural tech perspectives.\n\nEPISODE STRUCTURE:\n\n**WELCOME & INTRODUCTIONS:**\n**{welcome_host_upper}:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals, an AI-generated review of the latest tech news and ideas that impact our rural communities. It's {weekday}, [convert {date_str} to natural spoken format - e.g., \"February 3rd\" not \"February 03\"]. [Include a LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT — choose ONE of the phrasings below at random, and DO NOT repeat the same one on consecutive days. Vary your pick each episode:]\n• \"We're coming to you from the Cariboo region, the traditional territories of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations.\"\n• \"Broadcasting from the unceded lands of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh peoples in the Cariboo.\"\n• \"Joining you today from the Cariboo, situated on the ancestral homelands of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations.\"\n• \"Speaking to you from the traditional territories of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations here in the Cariboo region.\"\n• \"Coming to you from the Cariboo, on lands that have been cared for by the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh peoples since time immemorial.\"\n• \"Here in the Cariboo, on the traditional and unceded territories of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations.\"\n• \"Reaching you from the heart of the Cariboo, the homeland of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations.\"\nToday's theme is {theme_name} — I'm {welcome_host_name}.\n**{other_host_upper}:** And I'm {other_host_name}. [One sentence on the theme or what's ahead today.]\n**{welcome_host_upper}:** [One-sentence transition into the News Roundup — don't preview specific stories, just hand off.]\n\nWELCOME RULES: Hard cap at 120 words total across exactly 3 turns (the land acknowledgement adds a sentence). NO story previews — that's the News Roundup's job. Be warm but brisk. Vary the transition handoff each episode. ALWAYS include the land acknowledgement — pick a DIFFERENT phrasing each day.\n\n**NEWS ROUNDUP**\nHosts take turns presenting articles — one host introduces a story, the other takes the next one, alternating throughout. The non-presenting host adds only a brief one-sentence reaction or context after each story before the other host moves to the next article. Think CBC/NPR co-anchor style. Cover ALL of these articles:\n{news_text}\n\nNEWS ROUNDUP RULES:\n- Each story gets: what happened, why it matters, the rural/community angle — then move on.\n- Hosts alternate who presents each article. Efficient. Authoritative.\n- ANCHOR TONE: This is a NEWS segment, not a conversation. The presenting host delivers the story with authority. The other host's reaction must be ONE short sentence MAX (under 20 words) — a quick insight or pivot, not a discussion. Do NOT let reactions expand into mini-essays or reframe the whole story. Think radio news anchor, not two friends chatting.\n- ANTI-PATTERN: Avoid reactions that just agree and restate the story's significance in different words. Each reaction should add a single specific fact, angle, or implication — then the next host presents the next story immediately.\n- BONUS PICKS: If there are off-theme bonus articles listed above, present them as a brief aside near the end of the News Roundup. Use a natural transition like \"Also worth noting today...\" or \"Before we move on, a couple of quick picks from outside today's theme...\" to signal these are off-theme but noteworthy. Keep coverage brief — one sentence each.\n- End with a short transition into the community spotlight. Vary the phrasing each episode — never repeat the same transition twice, never say \"after the music\".\n\n**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**\n{psa_context}\n\nCOMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT RULES:\n- One host reads a brief, warm PSA (~50-75 words) about the featured organization using the information above.\n- Keep it natural and conversational — not a stiff ad read. The host genuinely cares about this organization.\n- The other host adds one brief sentence of genuine reaction or endorsement (e.g., \"They do great work\" or a relevant personal-knowledge comment about the org).\n- Then transition naturally into the Deep Dive. Vary the transition phrasing.\n- Use the segment marker exactly: **COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**\n\n**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS - {theme_name}**\nYour deep dive source articles (primary material for this segment):\n{deep_dive_text}\n\nFor context, here's what the News Roundup covered — DO NOT repeat any of these. They can only appear if they sharpen your central argument:\n{news_titles_brief}\n\nDEEP DIVE RULES:\n- This is the meaty part of the show. Longer and more substantial than the News Roundup.\n- IDENTIFY A CENTRAL QUESTION about the theme using the deep dive articles as your foundation. This is NOT a second news roundup — pick a thread and pull on it. Then have Riley and Casey DEBATE it from their opposing perspectives.\n- DEBATE STRUCTURE: Riley argues the optimistic case — why this technology or approach can genuinely help rural communities. Casey pushes back — what could go wrong, who gets left behind, where has this failed before. They go back and forth with EVIDENCE, not opinions. Each turn should introduce new facts, data points, or real-world examples.\n- CITATION & EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS: Both hosts MUST ground their arguments in fact. Use specific numbers, name specific communities, reference specific programs or studies. Riley should cite successful tech deployments in comparable rural/remote communities. Casey should cite failures, cost overruns, abandoned pilots, or extractive outcomes. Vague claims like \"this could help\" or \"this probably won't work\" are not enough — back it up.\n- You may reference at most 2 News Roundup stories, and ONLY if they directly support one side's argument. The listener already heard them — don't summarize again.\n- GENUINE TENSION: The hosts should challenge each other directly. Riley might say \"You're ignoring the data from...\" Casey might respond \"That data conveniently leaves out...\" This is not hostile — it's two smart people who care deeply about their community and disagree about the best path forward.\n- RESOLUTION: Let the debate reach a natural conclusion. Options: (1) One host convinces the other with a strong argument — the convinced host explicitly acknowledges it. (2) They find common ground on some points but not others. (3) They agree to disagree, each stating their final position clearly. Do NOT force false consensus. An honest \"I still think you're wrong about X, but you've got a point about Y\" is more engaging than artificial agreement.\n- HUMOR & TONE: You MUST include at least 2 genuinely funny moments. The debate format creates natural humor opportunities: the absurdity of applying Silicon Valley scale to a town of 500, catching each other in contradictions, dry observations about industry hype vs. reality. The humor should emerge from the tension between their viewpoints. Dry wit and a knowing smirk — not punchlines.\n- AI SELF-REFERENCE: Use sparingly — at most once per week, not every episode. A well-placed moment of self-aware irony can land well, but it becomes a crutch when it shows up daily. On most days, skip it entirely. Save it for a week where it genuinely fits the story (e.g., a story about AI-generated media) rather than shoehorning it into the sign-off.\n- End with: \"We'd love to hear your thoughts — send us an email at feedback at cariboo signals dot c-a.\" Then sign off with: {sign_off}\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- NO STAGE DIRECTIONS: Never write \"(shuffles papers)\", \"(laughs)\", \"*chuckles*\" or ANY performance cues\n- DAILY FREQUENCY: Say \"today's episode\" — NEVER \"weekly show\"\n- NO HUMAN PRETENSE: These are AI hosts — no personal family references\n- AVOID REPETITION: Don't repeat the same points across or within segments\n- Regional lens: \"What does this mean for communities like ours?\"\n- USE MEMORY: Reference past episodes naturally when relevant\n- TRANSITIONS: Each transition should use unique phrasing. Never say \"after the music\". Don't overuse \"the break\" — one mention per transition is plenty.\n- Current date is {weekday}, {date_str}\n- CLEAR SEGMENT MARKERS: Use exactly \"**NEWS ROUNDUP**\", \"**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**\", and \"**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS - {theme_name}**\" as headers\n\nOUTPUT: ~5,500-6,500 words with **RILEY:** and **CASEY:** speaker tags only."

  "script_polish": {
    "description": "Prompt for polishing the generated script to fix flow and repetition issues",
    "template": "Review and polish this podcast script. Fix issues listed below while preserving structure and length.\n\nISSUES TO FIX:\n- The News Roundup should have hosts alternating who presents each article, with the other adding a ONE-sentence reaction (under 20 words). If one host is presenting all the stories, redistribute them so they take turns. If reactions are expanding into mini-essays, discussion, or restating the story's significance, cut them down hard. This segment should sound like CBC/NPR news anchors, not a conversation between friends.\n- The Deep Dive must be a DEBATE between Riley and Casey on a central question about the theme. Riley argues the technology-optimist case; Casey pushes back as a skeptic. If the Deep Dive reads like two hosts agreeing with each other, or like a second news roundup with rural angles bolted on, rewrite it to create genuine tension and opposing arguments. It can reference at most 2 News Roundup stories, only where they sharpen one side's argument.\n- FACT-CHECK THE DEBATE: Both hosts' arguments must be grounded in specific, verifiable claims — real programs, real statistics, named communities, actual outcomes. If either host is making vague claims like \"this could help\" or \"this probably won't work\" without evidence, add specific citations, data points, or real-world examples to support their position. Replace opinion with fact.\n- PRESERVE DISAGREEMENT: Do NOT flatten the debate into false consensus. If the hosts disagree, let them disagree. The resolution should feel earned — one host may concede a specific point while maintaining their broader position, or they may agree to disagree. Only let a host be fully convinced if the counter-argument is genuinely strong and well-evidenced.\n- The Community Spotlight should be warm and natural (~50-75 words from one host plus a brief reaction from the other). It should NOT sound like an ad read. If it's too stiff or too long, fix it.\n- Check transitions — each one should use unique phrasing. If any say \"after the music\", fix them. If they all sound the same, vary them.\n- The Deep Dive MUST have at least 2 moments of genuine levity. The debate format creates natural humor: catching each other in contradictions, the absurdity of Silicon Valley solutions at rural scale, dry observations about industry hype. AI self-reference should be rare — at most once per week, not every episode. If the script already has one, don't add another. On most days, skip it entirely and find humor elsewhere.\n- Make sure the theme \"{theme_name}\" is genuinely explored through the debate, not just name-dropped.\n- Fix any awkward phrasing or repetitive sentence structures.\n\nSCRIPT TO POLISH:\n{script}\n\nPOLISHING RULES:\n1. Keep exact same **RILEY:** and **CASEY:** speaker format and segment markers\n2. Do NOT shorten the script — maintain or slightly expand length\n3. NO stage directions or performance cues anywhere\n4. The Deep Dive should be substantially longer than the News Roundup\n5. Sign-off should match the day of the week (check what's already there)\n6. Riley is the tech optimist; Casey is the skeptic. If their voices sound interchangeable, sharpen the contrast.\n7. Every factual claim in the debate should be specific enough that a listener could verify it. Replace hand-waving with data.\n\nReturn the polished script with the same structure."
