# Submitting Cariboo Signals to Apple Podcasts

Step-by-step guide for getting the podcast listed on Apple Podcasts and other directories.

## Pre-submission checklist

Before submitting, verify these requirements are met:

### 1. Cover art (ACTION REQUIRED)

Apple requires cover art between **1400x1400** and **3000x3000** pixels.

Current: `cariboo-signals.png` is **1024x1024** — this will be rejected.

To fix:
- Regenerate the cover art at 3000x3000 pixels (PNG or JPEG, RGB color space)
- Replace `cariboo-signals.png` in the repo root
- The RSS feed already references this file automatically

### 2. Contact email (ACTION REQUIRED)

The RSS feed currently uses a placeholder email: `podcast@example.com`

To fix:
- Edit `config/podcast.json`
- Change the `"email"` field to a real email address
- This email is used by Apple to contact the podcast owner about issues

### 3. RSS feed URL

Your feed URL is:
```
https://zirnhelt.github.io/curated-podcast-generator/podcast-feed.xml
```

This is publicly accessible and auto-updated daily by GitHub Actions.

### 4. Validate the feed

Run the validation script to check Apple compliance:

```bash
python3 validate_feed.py
```

This checks for all required and recommended iTunes tags, cover art dimensions, and common issues.

You can also validate with Apple's tool after submission at [Podcasts Connect](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com).

## Submitting to Apple Podcasts

1. **Go to** [podcastsconnect.apple.com](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com)
2. **Sign in** with your Apple ID (create one if needed — it's free)
3. **Click** the **+** button or "Add a Show"
4. **Paste** your RSS feed URL:
   ```
   https://zirnhelt.github.io/curated-podcast-generator/podcast-feed.xml
   ```
5. **Review** the preview — Apple will parse your feed and show:
   - Show title (Cariboo Signals)
   - Cover art
   - Episode list
   - Category (Technology, Society & Culture)
6. **Submit** for review

### What happens next

- Apple reviews new podcasts manually (typically 1-5 business days)
- You'll receive an email at the address in your RSS feed when approved
- Once approved, new episodes appear automatically — Apple polls your RSS feed periodically
- No ongoing action needed; your daily GitHub Actions pipeline handles everything

### If rejected

Common rejection reasons and fixes:
- **Cover art too small**: Regenerate at 1400x1400 or larger
- **Placeholder email**: Update `config/podcast.json` with a real email
- **Missing episodes**: Ensure at least one episode has a valid `<enclosure>` audio URL
- **Audio not accessible**: Verify `https://podcast.cariboosignals.ca/podcasts/` URLs are publicly reachable

## Submitting to other directories

Once your feed is ready for Apple, it meets the requirements for all major directories:

| Directory | URL | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| **Spotify** | [podcasters.spotify.com](https://podcasters.spotify.com) | Free, paste RSS URL |
| **Amazon Music** | [music.amazon.com/podcasters](https://music.amazon.com/podcasters) | Free, paste RSS URL |
| **Pocket Casts** | [pocketcasts.com/submit](https://pocketcasts.com/submit) | Free, paste RSS URL |
| **Google Podcasts** | Automatic | Indexed from RSS if publicly accessible |
| **Podcast Index** | [podcastindex.org/add](https://podcastindex.org/add) | Free, open index |

All directories auto-poll your RSS feed after the initial submission. No ongoing maintenance required.

## RSS feed technical details

The feed is generated by `podcast_generator.py` in the `generate_podcast_rss_feed()` function (line ~1180). It includes:

- All required Apple iTunes tags (`itunes:author`, `itunes:image`, `itunes:category`, `itunes:explicit`, `itunes:type`)
- Episode-level tags (`itunes:duration`, `itunes:explicit`, `guid`)
- Detailed episode descriptions with cited sources and credits
- Last 10 episodes (auto-rotated daily)

### Updating podcast metadata

All metadata comes from `config/podcast.json`:
- `title`, `subtitle`, `summary`, `description` — show-level text
- `author` — displayed as the podcast author
- `email` — Apple contact email (in `itunes:owner`)
- `categories` — Apple Podcasts categories
- `cover_image` — filename of cover art (relative to site root)
- `audio_base_url` — CDN base URL for audio files (Cloudflare R2)
