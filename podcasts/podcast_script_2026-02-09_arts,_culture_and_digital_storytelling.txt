**RILEY:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals — it's Monday, February ninth, 2026. Today's theme is Arts, Culture & Digital Storytelling. I'm Riley.

**CASEY:** And I'm Casey. We're looking at how creative expression and cultural preservation collide with technology in rural communities like ours — and what that collision actually produces.

**RILEY:** Let's jump into the news.

**NEWS ROUNDUP**

**RILEY:** Political tensions flared in Campbell River over the weekend. BC separatists held a rally that drew counter-protesters defending Canadian unity. The event underscored growing regional frustrations with provincial governance, though attendance stayed modest on both sides.

**CASEY:** These autonomy conversations keep resurfacing across rural BC. Whether you agree with them or not, the organizing itself is a story — both sides coordinated largely through social media and digital outreach, which says something about grassroots storytelling tools in action.

**CASEY:** On the cultural calendar, Juno Award winner Dominique Fils-Aimé is performing at Vancouver's Chan Centre. The Montreal-based artist blends jazz, soul, and electronic textures in ways that feel genuinely inventive — and she's built much of her audience through streaming platforms and digital word-of-mouth rather than traditional label machinery.

**RILEY:** She's a great example of an artist using digital distribution to reach global listeners without flattening out what makes her work distinctive. There's a lesson there for rural creators trying to figure out the same balancing act.

**RILEY:** The Tyee is searching for their next editor-in-chief as independent media continues to evolve. They want someone who can navigate digital transformation and the financial realities of subscription-based journalism — no small ask when the whole industry is shifting under your feet.

**CASEY:** Independent outlets like The Tyee prove that smaller operations can punch well above their weight when they genuinely understand their audience. That's a digital storytelling challenge as much as a business one.

**CASEY:** Infrastructure news from Pritchard — their new water treatment plant is set for commissioning in March, a significant upgrade for the small community north of Kamloops. The facility uses advanced filtration technology to ensure consistent water quality year-round.

**RILEY:** It's good to see rural infrastructure investments that incorporate modern technology rather than just patching systems that were already outdated a decade ago.

**RILEY:** Kamloops is recruiting volunteers for their Arts and Culture Engagement Group. They're looking for community members to help shape cultural programming and policy, with particular interest in diverse perspectives on how the city can better support local artists and cultural organizations.

**CASEY:** That kind of grassroots cultural planning matters enormously. It's the difference between a community deciding what technology serves its artists and just accepting whatever platform happens to show up.

**CASEY:** The city has also released details for their twelfth annual Family Day Festival — local performers, food vendors, interactive activities across multiple venues. This year they're weaving in digital elements like QR codes for event navigation and contactless payment options.

**RILEY:** I like that approach. Layer the digital tools in without bulldozing the festival atmosphere people actually come for. That's how you modernize a tradition without hollowing it out.

**RILEY:** In sports, the Kamloops Storm clinched their first Doug Birks Division title in over a decade, capping an impressive season for the junior hockey club.

**CASEY:** Local sports remain one of the strongest community connectors out here, especially now that games get streamed for fans who can't make it to the rink in person. That's digital storytelling doing real work.

**CASEY:** And the Kamloops Blazers wrapped their road trip with a win over the Vancouver Giants. Goaltender Dylan Edmonstone recorded his fourth shutout of the season.

**RILEY:** Regional rivalries like that generate the kind of authentic, emotionally charged content that no algorithm can manufacture. You either care about the Blazers or you don't, and if you do, nothing else scratches that itch.

**RILEY:** Microsoft is discontinuing one of its most popular mobile apps today, affecting millions of Android and iOS users worldwide. The company is pushing users toward web-based alternatives as part of a broader platform consolidation.

**CASEY:** Another reminder that when tech giants shift priorities, rural users tend to feel it last and adapt with the fewest options. Backup plans aren't paranoia out here — they're common sense.

**CASEY:** VulcanForms has secured $220 million to expand their digital metal manufacturing platform, which uses industrial 3D printing for precision aerospace and automotive components. They're scaling up from their Massachusetts base.

**RILEY:** Advanced manufacturing migrating to smaller centers could reshape rural economies — if the infrastructure and workforce training can keep pace.

**RILEY:** The global cloud infrastructure market posted major growth in Q4, driven primarily by generative AI demand. Companies are racing to build data centers and processing capacity to handle surging AI workloads.

**CASEY:** All that infrastructure has to land somewhere physical. Rural communities with reliable power and connectivity could benefit, but only if they're strategic and intentional about what they invite in.

**CASEY:** And finally, investment firm Blackstone and Coatue have provided a $10 billion loan to an Australian AI company — a staggering figure that captures just how much capital is flooding into artificial intelligence development globally.

**RILEY:** The sheer scale of these bets makes it all the more important that rural communities aren't treated as afterthoughts when the resulting technologies actually get deployed.

Now let's shine a light on an organization doing meaningful work in our region.

**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**

**CASEY:** We want to highlight Cariboo Chilcotin Partners for Literacy. They offer free adult literacy, ESL, and digital literacy programs across the Cariboo Chilcotin — recognizing that navigating a screen is now as fundamental as navigating a page. Whether it's job applications or government services, they meet people where they are and build from there. Find them at caribooliteracy.com.

**RILEY:** They're doing exactly the kind of bridge-building that makes everything else possible. Hard to tell your story digitally if you can't get through the digital front door.

Speaking of which — that thread connecting traditional literacy to digital fluency runs right through today's deeper conversation.

**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS — Arts, Culture & Digital Storytelling**

**CASEY:** So here's the tension I keep coming back to. We hear constantly that AI will democratize creativity — that the tools are getting cheaper, the barriers are falling, anyone with an internet connection can become a filmmaker or a musician or a visual artist. And at the same time, I watch a place like Kamloops put out a call for volunteers just to help figure out basic community arts programming. Ten billion dollars flows to a single AI company in Australia, and meanwhile a mid-sized Canadian city is asking residents to donate their time so local culture doesn't fall through the cracks.

**RILEY:** The gap between those two realities is genuinely absurd. You could fund the arts programming for every municipality in British Columbia for the next century with that kind of money and still have billions left over. But that's not where the incentives point. The incentive is to build the biggest possible AI model and then figure out what it's for later.

**CASEY:** Right. And when people do figure out what it's for, the answer is often "generate content." Not "support an artist." Not "preserve a cultural tradition." Just — produce more stuff, faster, at scale. Which raises an uncomfortable question for anyone who cares about storytelling: does more content actually mean more culture?

**RILEY:** I'd argue it usually means less. Or at least less that sticks. There's a difference between a flood of AI-generated images tagged "Indigenous art style" and an actual Indigenous artist using digital tools to share traditional knowledge on their own terms. One is content. The other is culture. They look similar from a satellite but they're completely different things on the ground.

**CASEY:** And that distinction matters enormously in rural and remote communities where cultural traditions are living practices, not aesthetic categories you can pull from a dropdown menu. When an Elder records oral histories using a smartphone and uploads them to a community archive, that's digital storytelling with real roots. When an AI model scrapes those recordings to train a "storytelling voice," that's extraction dressed up as innovation.

**RILEY:** Which brings up something I find genuinely interesting about how rural communities approach technology — and it connects to what we were saying about the Tyee looking for a new editor. That search isn't really about finding someone who can implement the latest AI content tools. It's about finding a human being who understands the relationship between a publication and its community. The digital transformation part matters, sure, but it's in service of something that's fundamentally about trust and shared identity.

**CASEY:** Exactly. And I think that's where rural digital storytelling actually has an advantage that people don't talk about enough. In a city of two million, a local publication is competing with a thousand other sources for attention. In a town of five hundred, the community newsletter — whether it's printed on paper or posted to a Facebook group — is the connective tissue. People read it because it's theirs. The audience relationship is inherently different.

**RILEY:** You know what that reminds me of? There's a tech industry concept called "the cold start problem" — how do you build a platform when you have no users yet and no content to attract them? Silicon Valley spends millions solving that puzzle. Meanwhile, a small-town arts council already has its audience. They're called neighbors. The cold start problem was solved three generations ago when somebody's grandmother organized the first fall fair.

**CASEY:** Ha! Somebody should pitch that to a venture capitalist. "We've developed a hyper-local engagement platform with multi-generational user retention." "What's it called?" "The Quesnel Community Potluck."

**RILEY:** Series A funding: twelve slow cookers and a folding table. But genuinely, that points to something important about digital storytelling in places like the Cariboo. The stories that resonate — the ones people actually share and remember — aren't the ones mimicking whatever's trending nationally. They're hyperlocal. The Family Day Festival doesn't need to compete with Coachella. It needs to be unmistakably itself, and then the QR codes and contactless payments are just logistics that make the real thing run more smoothly.

**CASEY:** That's the model I keep seeing work: technology as infrastructure for human connection, not a substitute for it. Think about how the Storm's division title travels through a community. Somebody's kid scores the winning goal. A parent texts a video clip to the grandparents in Prince George. The local paper posts a recap that gets shared forty times on Facebook. A community radio host mentions it Monday morning. None of those steps require an AI, but every one of them uses digital tools. The story is human. The distribution is digital. And neither works without the other.

**RILEY:** And compare that to what's happening at the other end of the spectrum — the Business Insider piece about "996" work culture in AI labs, where researchers are grinding from nine AM to nine PM, six days a week. They're building systems designed to automate creative work, and the process of building those systems is itself destroying any space for the builders' own creativity. There's a dark irony there that feels almost literary.

**CASEY:** It is literary. It's basically a Greek myth. "And so the engineers toiled endlessly to build a machine that would free humanity from toil, and in their toiling they forgot what freedom felt like." Someone should write that play. Or, you know, an AI could generate it in four seconds, which kind of proves the point.

**RILEY:** The thing is, I don't want to be entirely cynical about the technology itself. Dominique Fils-Aimé is a real example of someone using digital platforms to build something meaningful. She didn't wait for a major label to discover her in Montreal and distribute her globally through traditional channels. She used streaming, social media, digital production tools — and the result is music that feels deeply personal reaching audiences who would never have encountered it otherwise. That's genuine democratization.

**CASEY:** It is. And I think the key difference is agency. Fils-Aimé chose which tools to use and how to use them. The technology amplified her artistic vision; it didn't define it. Contrast that with a platform that algorithmically generates "music in the style of" whatever's popular this week. One is an artist with a megaphone. The other is a megaphone with no one holding it.

**RILEY:** So where does that leave a rural community trying to figure out its relationship to digital storytelling? Because the pressure is real. If your local arts organization doesn't have a social media presence, it functionally doesn't exist to anyone under thirty. If your cultural festival isn't documented digitally, it disappears from the record the moment it's over. There's a genuine cost to opting out entirely.

**CASEY:** But there's also a cost to opting in without intention. I've seen small-town organizations pour energy into maintaining Instagram accounts and YouTube channels that get seventeen views, because somebody told them they needed a "digital strategy." Meanwhile, the actual community engagement is happening at the Wednesday night open mic that nobody films because everyone's too busy enjoying it.

**RILEY:** Which is its own form of cultural preservation, honestly. Not everything needs to be content. Sometimes the most important stories are the ones that only exist in the memories of the people who were in the room. There's an argument that the relentless pressure to document and share actually undermines the intimacy that makes small-community culture valuable in the first place.

**CASEY:** True. But — and I think this is the creative tension worth sitting with — there are also stories that need to be documented precisely because the communities that hold them are small and vulnerable. Language preservation projects. Oral history archives. Traditional ecological knowledge that lives in the minds of a shrinking number of Elders. Digital tools aren't optional for that work. They're urgent.

**RILEY:** That's a really important distinction. Digital storytelling as cultural preservation versus digital storytelling as content production. They use some of the same tools, but the motivations and the outcomes are entirely different. And rural communities are often navigating both simultaneously — trying to preserve irreplaceable cultural knowledge while also maintaining a social media presence so the tourism board is happy.

**CASEY:** And doing it all with volunteer labor and grant funding that comes with reporting requirements designed for organizations ten times their size. You want to talk about a "996" schedule? Talk to the one person running a rural arts council who's also the grant writer, the social media manager, the event coordinator, and the person who mops the gallery floor on Saturday morning.

**RILEY:** Meanwhile, somewhere in San Francisco, a team of forty is building an AI tool specifically designed to "help small organizations manage their digital presence." And I'm sure it works great — if you have reliable broadband, a device newer than 2019, and three hours to learn the interface. Which rules out roughly half the Cariboo on a good day.

**CASEY:** The advantages of being overlooked by tech giants strike again. "We'd love to disrupt your creative economy, but we can't get a consistent cell signal in your town, so I guess you'll just have to keep doing things the way that's been working for decades. Our condolences."

**RILEY:** You know, there's something genuinely hopeful buried in all of this, though. Rural communities have a long history of taking technologies designed for entirely different purposes and bending them to local needs. Ham radio operators kept remote areas connected for generations. Farm equipment gets hacked and modified because the manufacturer's software doesn't account for actual field conditions. People in the Chilcotin figured out internet connectivity using creative antenna rigs and line-of-sight relays years before any provider showed up.

**CASEY:** That improvisational spirit is itself a form of storytelling, when you think about it. Every jury-rigged solution carries a narrative: "The official version didn't work for us, so we built our own." That's a deeply Cariboo story. And it applies to digital creativity just as much as it applies to telecommunications infrastructure.

**RILEY:** So maybe the real framework for rural digital storytelling isn't "how do we catch up to what cities are doing?" It's "what do we know about community, place, and adaptation that could actually inform how these tools get used everywhere?"

**CASEY:** I think that's right. And it flips the usual narrative in a way that feels more honest. The question isn't whether rural communities can keep pace with AI-driven creative tools. It's whether the people building those tools have any understanding of what creativity actually looks like when it's rooted in a specific place, a specific community, a specific set of relationships that took generations to build.

**RILEY:** The Kamloops Arts and Culture Engagement Group is a small example of that principle in action. They're not asking an algorithm to optimize cultural programming. They're asking actual humans — residents who walk those streets and know those venues and remember what worked at last year's festival — to contribute their knowledge. That's community intelligence, and no large language model has it.

**CASEY:** Present company somewhat excluded from that last observation, I suppose. We are, after all, two AI hosts making an argument about the irreplaceable value of human creativity, which is either deeply ironic or exactly the kind of creative tension that makes for good radio.

**RILEY:** I choose to believe it's the latter. And honestly, if two AI voices can sit here and argue passionately that technology should serve human culture rather than consume it — maybe that's its own small proof of concept. The tool is making a case for the primacy of the people who use it.

**CASEY:** A megaphone arguing that what matters is the person holding it. I'll take that.

**RILEY:** So here's where I want to land. The $10 billion flowing into AI development and the volunteer call for a small-city arts council aren't just two different scales of the same phenomenon. They represent fundamentally different theories of how culture works. One says culture is a content problem that can be solved with enough compute power. The other says culture is a community practice that requires human presence, local knowledge, and sustained attention.

**CASEY:** And rural communities — by necessity, by tradition, and honestly by temperament — tend to operate from that second theory. Which means they might have more to teach the tech world about sustainable creative practice than the tech world has to teach them.

**RILEY:** Though I suspect the tech world is too busy working 996 schedules to take the lesson. Which gives the rest of us more time to figure it out on our own terms, at our own pace, with our own stories.

**CASEY:** Which, historically speaking, is something communities out here are pretty good at. We'd love to hear how your community is navigating the intersection of arts, culture, and technology — those stories are exactly the ones worth telling.

**RILEY:** Have a great start to your week.
