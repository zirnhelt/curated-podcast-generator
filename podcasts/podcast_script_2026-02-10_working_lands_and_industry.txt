**RILEY:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals, it's Tuesday, February tenth, 2026. Today's theme is Working Lands & Industry — I'm Riley.

**CASEY:** And I'm Casey. We're looking at how technology intersects with the backbone of our regional economy — from ranching operations to resource extraction. Here's today's News Roundup.

**NEWS ROUNDUP**

**RILEY:** The City of Kamloops is hosting a Family Day Festival with a focus on recycling education. Residents can learn about proper waste sorting through interactive activities while celebrating the holiday. The event combines community celebration with environmental stewardship — the kind of dual-purpose programming that works well in smaller centers where every event needs to pull double duty.

**CASEY:** Smart way to reach families when they're already gathered together.

**CASEY:** Kamloops District Parent Advisory Council is pushing for reduced vehicle traffic near schools, extending their safety campaign beyond just drop-off zones. They're asking the school district to work with the city on traffic calming measures around all school sites.

**RILEY:** Coordinated planning between schools and municipalities is overdue in a lot of communities.

**RILEY:** ASK Wellness is preparing to reopen their Crossroads location after more than a year of closure. The facility provides mental health and addiction services, and staff are working through final preparations to welcome clients back. When you lose a service hub like this in a smaller community, the ripple effects touch families, employers, and other providers alike.

**CASEY:** A year-plus closure really shows how hard it is to rebuild essential services once they go down.

**CASEY:** Highway maintenance crews will be switching to overnight traffic patterns at the Highway 1 and Highway 11 interchange, with work happening between 7 PM and 6 AM to minimize disruption during peak travel hours.

**RILEY:** Scheduling around actual usage patterns matters more out here than in places with consistent all-day traffic.

**RILEY:** Kamloops Blazers goaltender Edmonstone earned WHL Goaltender of the Week honors after strong recent performances. Junior hockey remains a significant draw across the region, providing entertainment, a pathway for young athletes, and real economic activity from arena operations to hospitality.

**CASEY:** One of those threads that connects communities right across northern and central BC.

**CASEY:** A Lillooet couple discovered they'd won $2.5 million on Lotto 6/49, calling the experience "stunning" when they realized the magnitude of their win.

**RILEY:** Lillooet's small enough that news like that probably reached half the town within a day.

**RILEY:** Kamloops RCMP are seeking witnesses to a Friday hit-and-run that resulted in serious injuries. Police are asking anyone with information or dashcam footage to come forward.

**CASEY:** These investigations depend on community cooperation — people looking out for each other.

**CASEY:** Submer has acquired Radian Arc to create full-stack AI infrastructure spanning from core data centers to edge computing. The deal combines Submer's immersion cooling technology with Radian Arc's edge deployment capabilities, a vertical integration play aimed at getting AI infrastructure working across vast distances and varied conditions.

**RILEY:** Edge computing could genuinely level the playing field for rural areas if the buildout actually reaches them.

**RILEY:** Google is redesigning how users access Gemini within Android's upcoming desktop interface, making AI assistance more integrated into the operating system. The changes aim to reduce friction for users who want AI help without switching between applications.

**CASEY:** Interface design shapes behavior more than most people realize.

**CASEY:** Industry analysts argue that infrastructure gaps — not model development — represent the biggest opportunity in the global AI race. While companies compete on algorithmic advances, the real competitive advantage may come from solving deployment, power, and connectivity challenges.

**RILEY:** And reliability and cost matter just as much as raw speed when you're talking about infrastructure.

**RILEY:** TechCrunch reports early signs of AI burnout among the technology's most enthusiastic adopters. Heavy users describe fatigue from constantly evaluating which tasks to delegate to AI versus handling personally, suggesting that even beneficial technologies create new forms of decision overhead.

**CASEY:** There's probably a sweet spot between useful integration and exhausting yourself deciding when to use it.

**CASEY:** Tech reviewers tested Google's Gemini 3 Flash against Claude 4.6 Opus across nine challenging scenarios, with results revealing distinct strengths and weaknesses depending on the type of reasoning task involved.

**RILEY:** Model comparisons matter most when you're trying to solve specific problems rather than just kicking the tires.

Now let's turn to today's Community Spotlight.

**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**

**CASEY:** Today we want to highlight the Cariboo Agricultural Research Alliance. They conduct applied research specifically for Cariboo farmers and ranchers — practical work grounded in the growing conditions, market challenges, and day-to-day realities that define agriculture in this region. You can learn more about their current projects at cariboo-agricultural-research.ca.

**RILEY:** Research that starts from local conditions makes a real difference for producers weighing new approaches.

With that, let's get into the Deep Dive.

**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS — Working Lands & Industry**

**RILEY:** So today's theme is Working Lands & Industry, and I want to build out an argument that's been nagging at me. We keep hearing that advanced technology will transform agriculture, forestry, and resource extraction. And the capability is real — it's genuinely impressive. But there's a persistent translation problem between what gets built in Silicon Valley and what actually works on a cattle ranch outside Williams Lake in February.

**CASEY:** And it's not just a lag. It's not that rural industries are five years behind and eventually the tech will arrive. The gap is structural. The business incentives that drive technology development point away from working lands, not toward them.

**RILEY:** Let me ground this. One of the stories we flagged in the roundup was Submer acquiring Radian Arc to build full-stack AI infrastructure from core data centers all the way to the edge. That's a company explicitly trying to push computing power out of centralized facilities and into distributed locations. On paper, that's exactly what rural industry needs.

**CASEY:** On paper, absolutely. But let's talk about what "edge computing" actually looks like when the edge is a logging operation at the end of forty kilometres of gravel road. The engineering assumptions change completely. You're not deploying into a climate-controlled server closet in a suburban office park. You're dealing with dust, vibration, temperature swings from minus thirty to plus thirty-five, and power that comes from a diesel generator that someone remembered to fill this morning. Maybe.

**RILEY:** And that's the core of the translation problem. The fundamental technologies — optical networking, autonomous navigation, distributed computing — are becoming powerful enough that rural applications are theoretically feasible. Salience Labs is building photonics switches for AI networking. Tower Semiconductor is partnering with Nvidia on optical modules that handle 1.6 terabits per second. That kind of processing muscle could revolutionize how we monitor rangeland, track livestock, manage timber harvests.

**CASEY:** Could. Theoretically. But nobody at Salience Labs is losing sleep over whether their photonics switch works at minus twenty-five with condensation forming on the housing.

**RILEY:** Which gets at something important about how technology actually reaches working lands. It almost never arrives directly from the companies that develop the core capability. There's always a translation layer — someone who takes cutting-edge components and repackages them for conditions the original engineers never imagined.

**CASEY:** GPS is probably the best example of this pattern. Military precision navigation technology that sat in expensive, specialized hardware for years until someone figured out how to make it cheap, rugged, and simple enough for a farmer to bolt onto a tractor. And now GPS-guided equipment is standard across large-scale agriculture. But that translation took decades, and it required people who understood both the technology and the operational reality.

**RILEY:** Right. And the translation wasn't just about making it cheaper. It was about rethinking what the technology needed to do. Military GPS was optimized for pinpoint accuracy in real time. Agricultural GPS needed to be accurate enough, reliable across long days in harsh conditions, and simple enough that you didn't need an engineering degree to recalibrate it after hitting a rock.

**CASEY:** Different engineering priorities entirely. And that's where I think we need to be honest about what working lands actually require from technology right now. Most agricultural and forestry operations in our region don't need terabit optical networking. They need technology that can reliably process modest amounts of data under adverse conditions for a decade without requiring a technician visit. That's a completely different design challenge.

**RILEY:** It's almost the opposite challenge. Silicon Valley optimizes for maximum performance in controlled environments with abundant support infrastructure. Working lands need minimum viable performance in uncontrolled environments with essentially no support infrastructure. The rancher isn't calling an IT helpdesk when a sensor goes offline during calving season at two in the morning.

**CASEY:** No, the rancher is dealing with the calf. The sensor can wait.

**RILEY:** And that priority ordering is exactly right, which is something technology designers don't always grasp. On working lands, the technology has to fit around the work, not the other way around. You can't ask someone to restructure their calving operation to accommodate the data collection schedule of an AI system.

**CASEY:** Although I have to say, I'd pay good money to watch a Silicon Valley product manager try to pitch a rancher on "optimizing their bovine throughput pipeline."

**RILEY:** "Have you considered implementing agile methodology for your spring calving sprint?"

**CASEY:** "We'll schedule a standup. Six AM. In the barn. Dress code is rubber boots and regret."

**RILEY:** But this is where the argument actually gets interesting, because there's real opportunity hiding inside the translation problem. Consider Gather AI, which just raised $40 million for warehouse drones that autonomously navigate facilities and collect inventory data. Now, a warehouse and a hay barn aren't that different structurally — enclosed space, stored goods, need for inventory tracking. But the warehouse drone assumes consistent lighting, GPS signal, Wi-Fi coverage, and a level concrete floor.

**CASEY:** Meanwhile, the hay barn has barn swallows nesting in the rafters, a dirt floor that turns to mud in spring, lighting that consists of one bulb on a pull chain, and a cat that would absolutely attack a drone on sight.

**RILEY:** Sure. But the fundamental capability — autonomous navigation and visual inventory assessment — that translates. Someone who could take that core technology and make it work in agricultural buildings, in equipment yards, across rangeland — they'd be solving a problem that affects every agricultural operation in the region.

**CASEY:** And here's where scale works in an unexpected direction. The companies chasing warehouse automation are fighting over a relatively concentrated market — major logistics operators, big-box retailers, a few thousand high-value customers worldwide. Agricultural and resource operations number in the millions globally. The per-customer revenue is lower, but the total addressable market is enormous if you can crack the deployment challenge.

**RILEY:** Which brings us to who actually does this translation work. And honestly, this is where I think our region could play a more active role rather than just waiting for technology to arrive.

**CASEY:** We touched on the Cariboo Agricultural Research Alliance in our Spotlight, and that model — applied research starting from actual producer challenges — is exactly the right approach. But we probably need more of it, and with more ambition. Not just testing which crop varieties perform best in our climate, but actively partnering with technology companies to adapt their tools for our conditions.

**RILEY:** Think about what that could look like concretely. A research initiative that takes something like Gather AI's autonomous navigation platform and spends two years adapting it for rangeland monitoring. Working with actual ranchers to define what information they need, what conditions the technology has to survive, what price point makes adoption realistic. That's bridge-building work, and it's exactly the kind of thing that doesn't happen unless someone deliberately funds and organizes it.

**CASEY:** And the case for funding it is stronger than people might assume. Analysts in our roundup today argued that infrastructure gaps are the biggest opportunity in the global AI race. Well, the gap between AI capability and rural deployment is one of the biggest infrastructure gaps there is. Whoever solves it doesn't just serve the Cariboo — they serve agricultural and resource regions worldwide.

**RILEY:** Which is a genuinely compelling economic development argument. Instead of positioning rural communities as eventual consumers of urban technology, you position them as the testing ground and development hub for technology that works in challenging conditions. You're not waiting for Silicon Valley to notice you. You're building expertise that Silicon Valley can't replicate because they don't have access to the conditions, the users, or the operational knowledge.

**CASEY:** I mean, good luck stress-testing your rangeland monitoring drone in Palo Alto. "We simulated minus thirty by opening the office freezer."

**RILEY:** "Our test cattle were very cooperative. They were plush."

**CASEY:** There's a real policy dimension here too. Provincial and federal governments talk constantly about rural economic development and technology adoption. But most of the funding flows toward getting existing technology into rural hands — subsidizing broadband, offering adoption incentives. That's necessary, but it skips the translation step. It assumes the technology already exists in a form that works for rural applications, and often it doesn't.

**RILEY:** Redirecting even a fraction of that funding toward adaptation and translation — toward the engineering work that makes advanced technology functional in rural conditions — could have significant multiplier effects. You create local technical expertise, you develop exportable solutions, and you give producers technology that actually fits their operations rather than technology they have to reshape their operations around.

**CASEY:** And there's a data sovereignty angle that matters here, particularly for Indigenous-led operations. When we talk about sensors monitoring rangeland, drones surveying timber, AI analyzing agricultural data — all of that generates detailed information about land use, resource conditions, and operational practices. Who owns that data, where it's stored, and who can access it are not abstract questions for communities managing traditional territories.

**RILEY:** Edge computing and local processing become much more than technical preferences in that context. They're about maintaining control over information that has cultural, legal, and economic significance. The Submer and Radian Arc merger we mentioned earlier is interesting precisely because distributed infrastructure could support local data processing — but only if that's an intentional design priority, not an afterthought.

**CASEY:** Which circles back to why the translation work needs to happen here, with input from the communities that will use the technology. If the adaptation is done elsewhere, by people who don't understand these concerns, you end up with technology that technically functions but misses fundamental requirements around data governance and community control.

**RILEY:** So here's where I want to land this argument. The headline-grabbing AI infrastructure advances — photonics switches, warehouse drones, terabit optical modules — represent real capability. The gap between that capability and what working lands need isn't a sign that the technology is irrelevant. It's a sign that there's important, valuable, and potentially very profitable work to be done in translation and adaptation.

**CASEY:** And the communities best positioned to do that work are the ones that understand both sides of the equation — the technological possibilities and the operational realities of working lands. Places like the Cariboo, where you have active resource industries, agricultural operations facing real challenges, and growing technical capacity.

**RILEY:** The question is whether we treat that positioning as an asset and invest in it deliberately, or whether we keep waiting for technology designed for warehouses and data centers to somehow spontaneously adapt itself for rangeland and timber operations. Because it won't. That translation doesn't happen by accident. It happens when smart people with the right knowledge and adequate resources decide to make it happen.

**CASEY:** And when they do, the result isn't just technology that works for our region. It's technology that works for every region facing similar conditions — which is most of the world's agricultural and resource land. The export potential alone should get policymakers' attention.

**RILEY:** So Working Lands & Industry isn't just a theme about whether rural operations will eventually get better technology. It's about whether rural communities will be consumers of adaptation or creators of it. And that's a choice, not an inevitability.

**CASEY:** We'd genuinely like to hear your perspective on this — whether you're running a ranch, managing a woodlot, or working in resource extraction. How should technology development connect with working lands in our region?

**RILEY:** Have a great rest of your Tuesday.
