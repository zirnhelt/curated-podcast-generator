**RILEY:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals — it's Thursday, February twelfth, twenty twenty-six. Today's theme is Indigenous Lands and Innovation. I'm Riley.

**CASEY:** And I'm Casey. We're looking at how traditional knowledge systems and emerging technology find common ground, right here in the Cariboo. Let's get into the news.

**NEWS ROUNDUP**

**RILEY:** India is accelerating its clean energy transition, significantly closing the gap with China in renewable capacity additions. The country added over sixty gigawatts of renewable energy in twenty twenty-five, with solar installations leading the charge in rural and semi-urban areas. What's particularly relevant for regions like ours is India's focus on distributed energy systems — smaller-scale installations that serve local communities rather than massive centralized plants.

**CASEY:** That distributed model makes a lot of sense where transmission infrastructure is expensive to build.

**CASEY:** Astronomers have discovered something bizarre — a comet that completely stopped spinning, then started rotating in the opposite direction. Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks exhibited this unusual behavior as it approached the sun, likely due to outgassing from its surface creating uneven thrust. The European Space Agency tracked the phenomenon using advanced imaging capable of detecting rotational changes from millions of kilometers away.

**RILEY:** Remarkable sensitivity in those instruments — space observation keeps pushing what's measurable.

**RILEY:** A new offline voice transcription tool called Whisper is gaining traction for its ability to transcribe speech faster than most people can type, with no internet connection required. The software runs entirely on local hardware, processing audio through neural networks trained on diverse speech patterns. For rural users dealing with unreliable connectivity, this offline-first approach to AI represents a meaningful shift away from cloud-dependent services.

**CASEY:** Privacy advocates are especially interested since all processing stays on the device itself.

**CASEY:** Materials scientists have achieved a major breakthrough in three-D printing by successfully printing tungsten, one of the hardest engineering materials known. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal and resists traditional manufacturing methods. The new process uses specialized laser systems exceeding three thousand degrees Celsius, opening doors for aerospace, nuclear, and mining applications.

**RILEY:** That could reshape mining equipment manufacturing, which matters a great deal for the Cariboo's resource sector.

**RILEY:** The Tyee published a heartfelt piece about Tumbler Ridge, exploring what makes small northern communities resilient and distinctive. The article highlights how a former coal mining town is reinventing itself through tourism, paleontology, and outdoor recreation while maintaining its close-knit character. Tumbler Ridge's shift from resource extraction to a diversified economy offers real lessons for other Cariboo communities navigating similar transitions.

**CASEY:** A good reminder that rural reinvention tends to build on existing strengths rather than importing urban templates.

**CASEY:** Construction companies are increasingly adopting three-D printing technology for building projects, with implementations ramping up through twenty twenty-five and twenty twenty-six. These systems use concrete mixtures formulated specifically for additive manufacturing, cutting material waste by up to thirty percent compared to conventional methods. Projects require fewer on-site workers and can produce complex architectural forms that would be prohibitively difficult to build by hand.

**RILEY:** The labor implications for construction trades in smaller communities are worth watching closely.

**RILEY:** And finally, a maker built a fifteen-dollar smart clock using an ESP-thirty-two microcontroller that outperforms many commercial alternatives. The device features custom weather displays, calendar integration, and programmable lighting, all running on open-source software. The project shows just how accessible electronics prototyping has become, with components available online and extensive documentation for DIY enthusiasts.

**CASEY:** That's exactly the kind of build that thrives in high school maker spaces or community workshops.

**RILEY:** Next up, an organization doing vital work in our region.

**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**

**CASEY:** Today we're spotlighting the Cariboo Friendship Society, an urban Indigenous nonprofit that's been serving our community since nineteen sixty-nine. They offer housing support, youth programs, crisis intervention, and run The Hearth restaurant. With Heritage Day around the corner, it's a wonderful time to recognize over fifty years of dedication — learn more at cariboofriendshipsociety dot ca.

**RILEY:** They really do touch every part of community life, from crisis response to helping young people find their path.

**CASEY:** Now let's open up today's theme.

**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS — Indigenous Lands and Innovation**

**RILEY:** When we say "Indigenous Lands and Innovation" together, I think a lot of listeners picture two separate things being stapled to each other — traditional culture over here, shiny technology over there. But the more you look at what's actually happening on the ground, the more you realize that framing misses the point entirely.

**CASEY:** It does. And I think the disconnect starts with the word innovation itself. In mainstream tech culture, innovation means disruption — move fast, break things, replace what came before. But many Indigenous knowledge systems operate on a completely different logic. They're built around long-term stewardship, reciprocal relationships with land, and governance structures that have been refined over thousands of years. That's not the opposite of innovation. It's innovation measured on a different timescale.

**RILEY:** Which is a genuinely radical idea if you sit with it. We're so conditioned to think of innovation as whatever launched last quarter. Meanwhile, Indigenous land management practices like controlled burning shaped entire ecosystems across British Columbia for millennia — and now Western forest science is catching up and calling it "novel fire management strategy."

**CASEY:** Novel. Thousands of years old. Novel.

**RILEY:** The branding department works in mysterious ways. But seriously, that tension between deep traditional knowledge and the tech industry's perpetual amnesia runs through a lot of what we're seeing today. Take the offline transcription tool we mentioned — Whisper. On its face, it's a piece of software. But think about what it could mean for Indigenous language preservation. Elders can sit down, speak in their language, and generate transcripts without any of that audio leaving the room. No cloud server, no third-party data processing, no wondering which company's terms of service now apply to your grandmother's stories.

**CASEY:** That matters enormously, and it connects to one of the most important concepts in Indigenous tech right now — data sovereignty. The principle that Indigenous peoples have the right to govern how data about their communities, lands, and knowledge gets collected, stored, and used. Organizations like the First Nations Information Governance Centre have been developing frameworks around this for years, grounded in principles of ownership, control, access, and possession.

**RILEY:** And these aren't abstract policy documents gathering dust. They have real teeth. When a research team wants to study traditional ecological knowledge, or a tech company wants to train a language model on Indigenous speech, these frameworks establish that the community decides whether that happens, how it happens, and who benefits.

**CASEY:** Which brings up a practical problem. Most of these AI tools — Whisper included — were trained predominantly on English and a handful of other major global languages. So you have this technology that could be transformative for language revitalization, except the communities who need it most were excluded from the training data. The tool doesn't recognize Secwepemctsín or Tŝilhqot'in or Dakelh out of the box.

**RILEY:** Right, and here's where the innovation question gets genuinely interesting. Because filling that gap isn't just a technical challenge — it's a governance challenge. Who collects the speech samples? Who labels the training data? Where does the model live? Who has the right to modify it? These are questions that Silicon Valley tends to answer with "whoever moves fastest," and Indigenous data sovereignty frameworks answer with "whoever the community designates through its own decision-making processes."

**CASEY:** Those two approaches produce very different outcomes. And honestly, I think the Indigenous model is more robust. When you rush a language model to market without community consent, you might get a product. But you've also potentially violated cultural protocols around who can share certain words or stories, and you've created a tool the community doesn't trust. Whereas if you take the time to build it within a governance framework, you end up with something people will actually use and maintain.

**RILEY:** There's a parallel in how communities approach physical infrastructure, too. We talked about three-D printing in the news — the tungsten breakthrough, construction applications. The underlying promise is distributed manufacturing: making things locally instead of waiting for them to arrive on a truck from somewhere else. That resonates deeply in remote and Indigenous communities where supply chains have always been fragile.

**CASEY:** It does, although I want to be honest about the gap between promise and reality here. A tungsten three-D printer costs more than many First Nations' entire annual infrastructure budgets. So when someone in Vancouver says "distributed manufacturing will revolutionize remote communities," the question from those communities is usually, "Great, who's paying for the printer, who's training the operator, and what happens when it breaks?"

**RILEY:** I love the idea of a community meeting where someone presents the tungsten printer concept and an elder in the back row just asks, "But does it fix the water treatment plant?"

**CASEY:** And that's not anti-innovation — that's innovation literacy. Knowing which problems actually need solving and which solutions are proportionate to your context. A fifteen-dollar ESP-thirty-two clock might do more for a community learning center than a hundred-thousand-dollar printer that requires a materials science degree to operate.

**RILEY:** That fifteen-dollar clock is a great example, actually. Open-source design, off-the-shelf components, documentation available to anyone with an internet connection. It doesn't require a venture capital pitch deck or a partnership with a university research lab. Someone in the community can build it, understand it, modify it, and teach the next person how to do the same.

**CASEY:** And that cycle of building local capacity is crucial. One of the patterns I see in successful Indigenous-led tech projects is that they prioritize knowledge transfer alongside implementation. It's never just "here's a system, good luck." It's "here's a system, here's how it works, here's how to fix it, and here's how to decide whether you even want it in the first place."

**RILEY:** Which is such a contrast to how technology usually arrives in rural communities — as a finished product with a subscription fee and a customer service number in another time zone.

**CASEY:** If you're lucky enough to have cell service to call that number.

**RILEY:** The Tumbler Ridge story from the news roundup is relevant here too. That town didn't reinvent itself by importing someone else's economic model. They looked at what they had — paleontological resources, natural landscapes, existing community bonds — and built something from those assets. It wasn't glamorous or fast. But it was theirs.

**CASEY:** And that sense of ownership matters for sustainability. Initiatives that grow from within a community tend to outlast programs that get parachuted in from outside. There's research showing that Indigenous-led conservation areas often outperform government-managed protected lands in terms of biodiversity outcomes, precisely because the people managing them have multi-generational relationships with that landscape.

**RILEY:** I've seen those studies. And they challenge this notion that innovation requires outside expertise. Sometimes the deepest expertise is already present — it just doesn't come with credentials that bureaucratic systems recognize. An elder who can read a river system and predict salmon returns is working with a dataset that spans their entire lifetime and the lifetimes of everyone who taught them. That's not folklore. That's longitudinal ecological monitoring.

**CASEY:** With a sample size that would make most graduate students weep with envy.

**RILEY:** Exactly. And the most exciting work I'm seeing right now is where that kind of deep observational knowledge gets combined with modern sensing and data tools — not to replace the traditional knowledge, but to create a richer picture. Indigenous-led environmental monitoring programs that pair elder observation with satellite imagery, water sensors, and wildlife cameras. Neither dataset alone tells the full story.

**CASEY:** There's a project in northern British Columbia — the Indigenous Guardians programs — where community members serve as land stewards combining traditional practices with modern monitoring technology. They're collecting data on their own terms, using tools they've selected, within governance frameworks their communities control. That's what innovation looks like when it's grounded in place and relationship.

**RILEY:** And it produces better science. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have found that Indigenous Guardian programs detect ecological changes earlier and more accurately than conventional government monitoring. Partly because the monitors are out on the land consistently, and partly because they're noticing things that satellite data alone would miss — subtle shifts in plant behavior, changes in animal movement patterns, water quality indicators that don't show up in standard chemical tests.

**CASEY:** So when we talk about Indigenous Lands and Innovation, we're not talking about bringing innovation to communities that lack it. We're talking about recognizing innovation traditions that predate the word "technology" by millennia, and asking how contemporary tools can serve those traditions rather than supplant them.

**RILEY:** And there's a policy dimension here that affects everyone in the Cariboo, Indigenous or not. How governments fund rural innovation, what counts as a "technology project" in grant applications, whose expertise gets valued in planning processes — these decisions shape what's possible. If funding criteria assume innovation means apps and startups, a lot of genuinely transformative community-driven work gets left out.

**CASEY:** I've seen grant applications from Indigenous organizations doing extraordinary data sovereignty work get rejected because they didn't fit neatly into existing program categories. The bureaucratic imagination sometimes can't accommodate innovation that doesn't look like what it expects.

**RILEY:** Picture a grants officer reading an application that says "we want to build a community-governed database of traditional ecological knowledge using open-source software and elder-verified protocols" — and checking the "does not meet criteria" box because there's no commercialization pathway.

**CASEY:** Meanwhile the application for a blockchain-based supply chain solution for artisanal something-or-other sails through because it has the right buzzwords.

**RILEY:** There's a broader lesson in all of this for how rural communities — Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike — approach technology. The most durable innovations tend to be ones that communities shape to fit their own needs, rather than ones they reshape themselves to fit. That sounds obvious, but it runs counter to how most technology gets deployed.

**CASEY:** It does. And I think the Indigenous data sovereignty movement is ahead of the curve on this. The questions they're asking — Who controls this? Who benefits? What happens when things go wrong? Does this align with our values? — those are questions every community should be asking about every new technology that arrives at their doorstep.

**RILEY:** Whether it's a transcription tool, a three-D printer, a broadband project, or an AI system promising to optimize municipal services. The technology is only as good as the governance around it.

**CASEY:** And governance, ultimately, is a human practice. It's people sitting in rooms — or around fires, or on Zoom calls from spotty connections — making decisions together about what matters and what to do about it. No algorithm replaces that.

**RILEY:** That feels like the thread connecting everything we've talked about today. Innovation isn't a product you buy or a program you implement. It's a practice of paying close attention to your context, using whatever tools serve your purposes, and maintaining the relationships and governance structures that keep the whole thing accountable.

**CASEY:** And in the Cariboo, where Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities share geography and increasingly share challenges — from wildfire to connectivity to economic transition — there's real opportunity to learn from each other about how to do that well.

**RILEY:** If you're involved in community-driven innovation work, or if today's conversation sparked something you'd like to share, we'd love to hear from you through the show website or on social media.

**CASEY:** Enjoy the rest of your Thursday.
