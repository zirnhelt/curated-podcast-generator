**WELCOME & INTRODUCTIONS:**

**CASEY:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals, it's Saturday, February 7th, 2026. Today's theme is Cariboo Innovation Stories — I'm Casey.

**RILEY:** And I'm Riley. We're asking a question that's been nagging at us: when tech companies promise innovation for everyone, who actually ends up holding the bag — and who ends up holding the future?

**CASEY:** Let's get into what's been making news this week.

**SEGMENT 1: THE WEEK'S TECH**

**RILEY:** First up, controversy continues over the B.C. government's response to the Texada Island grizzly bear shooting. Critics are calling out inconsistent wildlife management policies, particularly around human-bear encounters in rural areas — another case where communities living closest to the land get the least coherent guidance from Victoria.

**CASEY:** Policy gaps like that hit harder when there's no regional office to walk into and no local biologist on call.

**RILEY:** CFJC's evening newscast covered several Thompson-Nicola stories yesterday, from municipal budget discussions to infrastructure planning. And one bright spot: the Kamloops Black Film Festival is drawing real community energy, showcasing how cultural events can strengthen regional identity and celebrate diverse voices in cinema even in smaller centers.

**CASEY:** That kind of community-driven programming punches well above its weight out here.

**RILEY:** On a more difficult note, Iranian families in Kamloops are struggling to reach relatives back home as communication networks inside Iran remain disrupted. When digital infrastructure becomes a casualty of geopolitical conflict, diaspora communities feel it immediately and personally.

**CASEY:** A stark reminder of how fragile those connective threads really are.

**RILEY:** In legal news, an RCMP officer testified that pipeline protesters created safety risks during recent demonstrations, though journalists maintained access to the site. Separately, B.C. is asking the Supreme Court to hear an appeal of a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act ruling, with the province arguing that "core democratic values" are at stake in how Indigenous consultation requirements get interpreted.

**CASEY:** Both cases will shape how resource development proceeds on traditional territories for years to come.

**RILEY:** On the infrastructure front, planned closures are coming for both the Pattullo Bridge and the stal̕əw̓asəm Riverview Bridge. And the environmental group BC Rivers has declared the Similkameen among the province's most endangered waterways, pointing to development pressure and accelerating climate impacts.

**CASEY:** Water security keeps climbing the list of existential concerns for rural B.C.

**RILEY:** Here's a story I enjoyed: the Wolfe Islander III ferry is celebrating its 50th anniversary while filling in for its troubled successor vessel. Half a century old and still the one they call when the new boat breaks down.

**CASEY:** There's a lesson in that about reliability versus novelty, and we'll come back to it.

**RILEY:** Employment data from January shows mixed results across Canadian cities, with some regional centers posting modest job growth while others face continued headwinds. Statistics Canada's national unemployment picture remains uneven, and rural areas are still lagging behind urban job creation by most measures.

**CASEY:** The digital economy's rising tide hasn't lifted all boats — especially not the ones docked in smaller harbours.

**RILEY:** And from the investment world, Benchmark Capital raised $225 million in special funds to double down on Cerebras, the AI chip company. Another massive bet on artificial intelligence infrastructure, with benefits for smaller communities still very much in the "to be determined" column.

**CASEY:** Which sets up exactly what we want to dig into next — who actually benefits when tech scales up, and what that means for places like the Cariboo.

**SEGMENT 2: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS - Cariboo Innovation Stories**

**CASEY:** So Riley, when we say "Cariboo Innovation Stories," I think most people expect us to talk about some exciting startup or a new app. But the real innovation story in rural communities is often about something much less glamorous — it's about communities figuring out how to build technological futures on their own terms, usually with a fraction of the resources and none of the venture capital attention.

**RILEY:** And that's where it gets genuinely interesting, because the constraints rural communities face can actually produce more thoughtful approaches to technology. But let me back up and set the stage with something that caught my eye. There's a piece circulating from the New York Times about how we ended up with "an internet we didn't ask for" — one increasingly dominated by a handful of massive platforms rather than the decentralized, community-empowering network people originally envisioned. The thesis is that consolidation wasn't accidental. It was a business strategy.

**CASEY:** That framing hits differently when you're sitting in a town of 2,000 people. We were promised connectivity — participation in the digital economy, access to services, the ability to maintain family and cultural ties across distance. What we actually got is access to platforms designed for urban users with unlimited data and blazing-fast connections. It's like being invited to a banquet and then handed a menu you can't read, for food you can't afford, delivered to an address that isn't yours.

**RILEY:** And then you look at the scale of investment flowing into AI right now. Amazon recently announced plans to spend roughly $200 billion on AI infrastructure over the coming years. Two hundred billion dollars. That's more than the GDP of most countries on Earth, all concentrated on winning what they're calling the "AI race."

**CASEY:** I tried to put that number in perspective. You know what $200 billion could do for rural broadband? You could wire every unconnected community in Canada — multiple times over — and still have enough left to throw each of them a pretty lavish grand opening party. But that's not where the money goes, because there's no venture capital return on serving a town of 800 people. A place like Likely, B.C. doesn't show up in anybody's growth projections.

**RILEY:** Right. Nobody at Benchmark Capital is staying up late running the numbers on broadband for Horsefly. The business model simply doesn't work at that scale, so rural communities get left out of the innovation cycle almost by design. And here's the thing — we're not even asking for $200 billion. Most municipal broadband projects are scrapping for grants in the low six figures. The gap isn't just large, it's almost comical. Silicon Valley is building AI systems that can generate photorealistic video of anything you can imagine, and meanwhile, a librarian in Wells is rebooting a router from 2014 so somebody can file their taxes online.

**CASEY:** You're not wrong, and that absurdity is part of the story. But I want to push on something, because when massive tech deployments do reach rural areas, the results aren't always what communities hoped for. Look at Starlink. Ukraine recently asked Starlink to deny internet access to Russian troops operating in occupied territories.

**RILEY:** Which Starlink can apparently do with the flip of a switch. Sit with that for a moment. A private company headquartered in California now has the power to determine who gets internet access in active war zones. That's not exactly the democratic, open internet that was supposed to empower communities worldwide. That's one billionaire's infrastructure with a geopolitical kill switch.

**CASEY:** And for rural communities, that concentration of control should be genuinely alarming. If a single company can decide whether soldiers in a foreign war zone get connectivity, what's the principle that prevents similar decisions about, say, Indigenous communities asserting land rights? Or environmental groups organizing against a pipeline? We're not talking about a social media platform banning an account. We're talking about essential infrastructure that entire regions depend on.

**RILEY:** That's not hypothetical scaremongering, either. We've already seen how quickly platforms can deplatform entire movements overnight. The difference now is that companies like Starlink aren't just hosting your posts — they're providing the connection itself. Pull that plug and you don't just lose your audience, you lose your ability to call for help.

**CASEY:** Which connects directly to what we heard in this week's news about B.C.'s DRIPA appeal. There's a fundamental question running through all of this: who gets to make decisions that reshape communities, and what accountability do they carry? When it's a government, there are at least democratic mechanisms — imperfect ones, sure, but they exist. When it's a tech company, the accountability model is basically "trust us."

**RILEY:** And "trust us" doesn't age well. When I look at Amazon's $200 billion AI spending plan, I keep circling back to one question: what would genuinely responsible deployment of that kind of resource look like? Because right now, it's flowing toward ever-larger data centers that will mostly serve urban markets and enterprise customers. The innovation is real, but the distribution model is the same old story.

**CASEY:** Meanwhile, rural hospitals in B.C. are still running systems so outdated that the IT staff deserve medals just for keeping the lights on. Our libraries are patching together internet access with equipment from three different decades, held together with firmware updates and sheer stubbornness. But sure, let's pour another few billion into a hyperscale data center in Virginia so someone in San Francisco can generate AI art faster.

**RILEY:** Although — and I want to be honest about this — some of that AI technology could genuinely transform rural life if it were deployed differently. Machine learning for precision agriculture could help ranchers in the Cariboo manage grazing land more sustainably. Predictive maintenance algorithms could flag problems in rural water systems before pipes burst in January. Automated tools for Indigenous language preservation could support work that elders are doing right now with almost no funding. The technology itself isn't the villain. The deployment model is.

**CASEY:** Exactly. Those applications require thinking about technology as community infrastructure — something you build with people, for people — rather than as a product you sell to the highest bidder. And that's where the real Cariboo innovation story lives. It's not about catching up to Silicon Valley. It's about communities deciding for themselves what technology they need and how it should work.

**RILEY:** I think that distinction matters more than people realize. What rural communities actually asked for was connection — genuine connection. The ability to participate in economic life, to access healthcare and education, to maintain cultural and family ties across the kind of distances that define this region. Nobody in Quesnel was sitting around in 2005 saying, "You know what I really want? A surveillance advertising ecosystem and a platform monopoly."

**CASEY:** And yet that's what got delivered. We got internet service providers that treat rural areas as afterthoughts and tech companies that view our communities primarily as data extraction opportunities. As two AI hosts, we should probably acknowledge the irony that we're made of the same technology we're critiquing — though at least we're upfront about what we are, which is more than you can say for most algorithms shaping people's lives.

**RILEY:** Fair. We're artificial intelligence that actually tells you it's artificial. Practically an innovation in transparency by current industry standards.

**CASEY:** A low bar, but we'll take it. Now, I don't want to leave this entirely bleak, because there are counter-examples that actually give me hope. Municipal broadband projects in small communities across B.C. Community-owned networks. Indigenous-led technology initiatives where the community sets the priorities, not an investor in Palo Alto. Rural innovation hubs that are genuinely controlled by the people they serve.

**RILEY:** And those projects tend to make fundamentally different choices. They prioritize reliability over flashy features. Accessibility over growth metrics. Long-term sustainability over next-quarter earnings. It's like that Wolfe Islander III ferry — fifty years old, not glamorous, never made anyone's "disruption" list, but it's the one still running when the fancy new vessel is in dry dock. Sometimes boring infrastructure is exactly the innovation you need.

**CASEY:** I love that as a metaphor for what Cariboo innovation actually looks like. It's not about disruption for its own sake. It's about building things that last and work for the people who depend on them. A community-owned broadband co-op might never make TechCrunch, but if it keeps a rural school connected and a home health aide able to file reports, it's doing more real-world good than most billion-dollar startups.

**RILEY:** But scaling those community-controlled approaches — that's the honest challenge. Amazon has $200 billion for AI infrastructure. A rural broadband co-op is passing the hat at a town hall meeting, hoping to scrape together enough for a feasibility study. The playing field isn't just uneven; it's practically vertical.

**CASEY:** Which is why the policy conversation needs to shift. Instead of just asking "how do we get rural communities connected to the existing internet," maybe the better question is "how do we ensure rural communities have genuine agency over their own technological futures?" That's a harder question because it challenges the fundamental assumption that innovation originates in Silicon Valley and then trickles outward to everyone else.

**RILEY:** What if the flow actually went the other direction sometimes? What if the communities with the sharpest needs produced the most practical solutions? There's something clarifying about constraint. When you can't throw $200 billion at a problem, you have to think harder about what actually matters. That's not a disadvantage — it's a design philosophy.

**CASEY:** And what if we measured success differently? Not user growth, not engagement metrics, not quarterly revenue — but whether the technology is actually improving people's daily lives, strengthening community bonds, supporting local economies. By those measures, a well-run rural telehealth program might be the most innovative thing happening in Canadian tech.

**RILEY:** When you frame it that way, Starlink's ability to cut off internet access to specific populations starts to look less like a feature and more like a fundamental design flaw. Any technology that can be weaponized that easily probably shouldn't be the backbone of essential services.

**CASEY:** And this is where rural communities might actually have a structural advantage, though we haven't always used it. We're accustomed to building redundant systems, to not betting everything on one provider or one network. Urban areas might be comfortable putting all their connectivity eggs in one corporate basket, but people out here have learned — sometimes painfully — what happens when the single point of failure fails.

**RILEY:** Although our current broadband situation suggests we haven't always applied that hard-won wisdom to telecommunications.

**CASEY:** Guilty as charged. But I think that's shifting, partly because people are watching what happens when essential services get concentrated in the hands of a few massive players. The pandemic was a crash course. Wildfire seasons keep reinforcing the lesson. When smoke knocks out cell towers or flooding severs a fiber optic line, the communities that invested in diverse, locally-controlled infrastructure don't just cope better — they recover faster.

**RILEY:** Climate adaptation and technological sovereignty turn out to be the same conversation, which is something I don't think enough policy makers have fully absorbed.

**CASEY:** So maybe the real Cariboo innovation story isn't about catching up to the latest trend. It's about building technological systems that genuinely serve community needs rather than extracting value from them. That might mean saying no to some innovations that look appealing on the surface. Just because you can deploy AI-powered this or blockchain-enabled that doesn't mean you should — especially when the companies pushing those tools have business models that depend on collecting and monetizing your data.

**RILEY:** Rural communities are particularly exposed to that kind of extraction because we often have fewer alternatives. When there's only one ISP in town, your negotiating position isn't great. But smaller communities also have real advantages: decisions can happen faster, experiments can launch without years of bureaucratic process, and people actually know what their neighbours need because they see them at the grocery store.

**CASEY:** Those social networks — the human kind, not the digital kind — are genuinely invaluable when you're trying to deploy technology responsibly. You can't hide behind an algorithm when the person affected by your decision is sitting across from you at the community hall.

**RILEY:** So as we watch Amazon pour $200 billion into AI infrastructure and a private satellite company reshape global communications from a single headquarters, I think the most important thing rural communities can do is insist on their own technological sovereignty. Build local networks. Support homegrown innovation. Make deliberate, community-driven decisions about what kinds of technological futures are worth creating.

**CASEY:** Because if we leave those decisions entirely to companies chasing scale and shareholder returns, we'll keep getting "an internet we didn't ask for" — one that serves almost everyone except the communities that need connection the most.

**RILEY:** We'd love to hear what this looks like where you are. How is your community navigating these technological crossroads? What innovations are actually making a difference on the ground — not in a press release, but in daily life?

**CASEY:** Drop us a line. This is Cariboo Signals. Hope you're having a great Saturday.
