**WELCOME & INTRODUCTIONS:**

**CASEY:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals, an AI-generated review of the latest tech news and ideas that impact our rural communities. It's Sunday, February fifteenth, 2026. Here in the Cariboo, on the traditional and unceded territories of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations. Today's theme is Resilient Rural Futures — I'm Casey.

**RILEY:** And I'm Riley. We're exploring how communities like ours can build lasting foundations for the next decade of change.

**CASEY:** Let's get into the headlines shaping technology and infrastructure this week.

**NEWS ROUNDUP**

**RILEY:** In green transportation, Australian mining company Fortescue is deploying battery-powered trains to meet tightening emissions deadlines across remote mining operations. These electric rail systems prove that battery technology can handle heavy industrial workloads in isolated terrain — a signal that electric freight could eventually reach sparsely populated corridors like ours in BC.

**CASEY:** Industrial-scale battery rail in the outback is a benchmark worth watching.

**RILEY:** Next, astronomers have calculated that a particular supermassive black hole generates energy roughly one hundred trillion times greater than the Death Star's fictional output. The research relied on distributed computing networks and citizen science platforms, showing how anyone with decent internet can contribute to frontier astrophysics.

**CASEY:** Distributed science doesn't care about your postal code, which is exactly the point.

**CASEY:** Turning to practical tools, many users are replacing AirDrop with LocalSend, an open-source file sharing application that works across Android, Windows, Linux, and Mac devices over local networks. For rural offices and community centres juggling a mix of donated and personal hardware, it's a reliable sharing solution that doesn't lock you into any single corporate ecosystem.

**RILEY:** A genuine lifesaver for anyone managing a patchwork of devices.

**CASEY:** On the security research front, developers are using Ghidra, the NSA's publicly released reverse engineering tool, to dissect the firmware of educational Dash robots used in schools. For rural libraries and classrooms concerned about what data these devices collect, open-source analysis tools put transparency back in the hands of the community.

**RILEY:** Exactly the kind of scrutiny educational technology should face everywhere.

**RILEY:** Here's one for the tinkerers — someone rigged an old Nintendo Wiimote to work as a PC mouse using two candles as infrared tracking points. It's gloriously impractical, but it demonstrates how creative hardware repurposing can squeeze new life out of obsolete tech when conventional options aren't handy.

**CASEY:** Peak rural ingenuity, even when nobody asked for it.

**CASEY:** And a privacy note for Samsung TV owners: your sets are actively collecting viewing data and usage patterns by default. The opt-out settings are buried deep in submenus. In small communities where digital anonymity is already thin, it's worth the five minutes to audit what your devices are actually reporting.

**RILEY:** A good reminder that the default settings rarely have your interests at heart.

**RILEY:** Now let's turn to an organization doing meaningful work right here in our region.

**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**

**RILEY:** Today we're highlighting Community Futures Cariboo Chilcotin, a nonprofit with a volunteer board that supports rural entrepreneurs across our region. They offer business loans, mentoring, and planning help — whether you're launching a tech-enabled service or adapting a traditional operation. They understand the particular realities of building something in a small market. You can find them at cfdccariboo.com.

**CASEY:** They've helped local businesses navigate everything from e-commerce setup to grant applications — the kind of hands-on regional expertise that turns a decent idea into a going concern.

**RILEY:** That leads us naturally into today's bigger question about what resilient foundations actually look like for communities like ours.

**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS — Resilient Rural Futures**

**RILEY:** Here's the question I want to put on the table today: Should rural communities invest in self-hosted, locally controlled technology infrastructure, or are we better served relying on centralized cloud services? I'm going to argue that local control isn't just idealistic — it's increasingly practical, increasingly affordable, and ultimately the only path to genuine resilience.

**CASEY:** And I'm going to argue that self-hosted infrastructure in communities our size is a romantic idea that collapses under the weight of real-world maintenance, expertise gaps, and costs that advocates consistently undercount. Lay out your case, Riley.

**RILEY:** Gladly. The cost curve for local infrastructure has shifted dramatically. Fiber installation costs dropped roughly sixty percent between 2015 and 2024 according to the Fiber Broadband Association's annual deployment reports. Modern self-hosted software like Nextcloud for file sharing or Hazel for automated backups eliminates many of the recurring service fees that made earlier community tech projects unsustainable. And this isn't theoretical. The town of Olds, Alberta launched O-Net, their municipal fiber cooperative, starting in 2013. Today it delivers gigabit service to residents for sixty dollars a month. Telus charges comparable communities ninety to one hundred and ten dollars for slower tiers.

**CASEY:** Olds is everyone's favourite example, so let's actually look at it. O-Net required over forty million dollars in capital investment for a town of about nine thousand people. That's roughly forty-four hundred dollars per resident before anyone plugged in a modem. The project needed multiple municipal bond issues, years of construction, and ongoing subsidy through property taxes. When the Olds Institute for Community and Regional Development did their own review, they acknowledged that uptake was slower than projected in the first three years and that debt servicing remained a significant budget line item. Most Cariboo communities have populations between three hundred and three thousand. They simply cannot absorb that kind of capital risk.

**RILEY:** You're citing the capital cost of a full fiber buildout, which is the most expensive possible version of local infrastructure. I'm not suggesting every village of five hundred people trench fiber to every doorstep. Start smaller. A community mesh network using modern equipment — Ubiquiti or Mikrotik hardware — runs about one hundred fifty to two hundred dollars per household to establish. Pair that with a modest shared computing setup. A small Proxmox server cluster capable of running Nextcloud, Jitsi video conferencing, and local backup services costs roughly fifteen to twenty thousand dollars, not fifty. For a community of three hundred households, you're looking at seventy-five thousand total to get started. Compare that to what those same three hundred households send to Microsoft and Google every year — at roughly fifteen dollars per user per month for Google Workspace, that's fifty-four thousand dollars annually leaving the community. The local system pays for itself inside two years.

**CASEY:** I appreciate the itemized math, but you've left out the most expensive line item: labour. Who administers these Proxmox servers? Who handles security patches for Nextcloud, which has issued over forty security advisories since 2020? Who troubleshoots when the Ubiquiti access points drop connectivity during a January cold snap at minus thirty-five? A qualified Linux systems administrator in BC commands sixty-five to eighty-five thousand dollars a year in salary. A community of three hundred households cannot justify that position. So you're relying on volunteers, which means you're relying on one or two technically skilled people donating hundreds of hours annually. The moment your volunteer admin moves to Kelowna for work or simply burns out, your entire community infrastructure becomes an unpatched, slowly degrading liability.

**RILEY:** That's a real concern, but it's being solved in practice by regional cooperation models. Look at the Columbia Basin Broadband Corporation in the Kootenays. They serve multiple small communities across a vast geographic area by pooling technical resources regionally. One team of professionals supports infrastructure across dozens of communities, spreading the cost so that no single town bears the full salary burden. The Cariboo Regional District could coordinate something similar. You don't need a full-time sysadmin in every village — you need a shared technical team serving the region, the same way we already share building inspectors and emergency coordinators across municipal boundaries.

**CASEY:** The Columbia Basin Broadband Corporation is a useful comparison, but it also proves my point about scale requirements. CBBC was capitalized with over six million dollars from the Columbia Basin Trust, which draws on BC Hydro reservoir payments — a funding source unique to that region and unavailable in the Cariboo. They also operate primarily as a connectivity provider, not as a full-stack community computing platform. There's an enormous difference between maintaining fiber and wireless links — which is already hard — and running the application layer on top of it. You're proposing both, which multiplies the complexity and the failure modes.

**RILEY:** Fair point on the funding source, but the organizational model still transfers. And I'd argue the application layer is actually getting simpler, not harder. Nextcloud's Docker deployment takes about an hour to set up and largely self-maintains with automated updates. YunoHost packages dozens of self-hosted applications behind a single admin interface designed for non-experts. The technical barrier to running basic community services has dropped enormously in the past five years. You don't need a team of senior engineers — you need people with solid fundamentals and good documentation, which is exactly the kind of capacity that community technology training programs can build.

**CASEY:** You just said "largely self-maintains with automated updates," and I want to pull on that thread, because it's the kind of claim that sounds reassuring until something breaks. In March 2023, a Nextcloud update introduced a database migration bug that locked users out of their files until administrators manually ran a repair command against the underlying database. If you're a corporate IT team, that's an annoying Tuesday. If you're a volunteer admin in Horsefly who's also a rancher and hasn't checked the server in two weeks, that's three hundred households without access to their documents, photos, and shared files. Automated updates are not the same as automated reliability.

**RILEY:** Alright, that Nextcloud incident is a fair hit. But let me flip the resilience argument, because I think you're applying a double standard. When Rogers experienced their catastrophic network outage on July 8th, 2022, roughly twelve million Canadians lost internet, mobile, and in many cases payment processing for up to eighteen hours. Interac went down nationally. People couldn't call 911 in some regions. Rural communities were hit hardest because they had the fewest alternative connections. That wasn't a volunteer running a server in a barn — that was a twenty-billion-dollar telecommunications company with thousands of engineers, and it still failed catastrophically. Centralised infrastructure concentrates risk. When it fails, everyone fails simultaneously with zero local recourse.

**CASEY:** The Rogers outage is actually a perfect illustration of why I'm skeptical of your position, not supportive of it. Rogers failed because running complex telecommunications infrastructure is staggeringly difficult even with billions of dollars and armies of engineers. A BGP routing table misconfiguration cascaded through their entire backbone — the kind of failure that requires deep expertise in network architecture to even diagnose, let alone prevent. You're proposing that volunteer-run community organizations should take on infrastructure responsibilities that overwhelm billion-dollar corporations. The Rogers outage doesn't prove that centralized systems are unreliable — it proves that all complex infrastructure is unreliable, and the question is who has more resources to restore service quickly. The answer is never the volunteer in Horsefly.

**RILEY:** But that's exactly my point about distributed resilience versus centralized fragility. When your local system goes down, it affects three hundred people and someone local can start troubleshooting immediately. When Rogers goes down, twelve million people wait helplessly for a corporate team in Brampton to fix a BGP table. The blast radius matters. And communities with local infrastructure had options during the Rogers outage — those with independent local networks maintained internal communications even when the national backbone went dark. That's not theoretical resilience, that's demonstrated resilience.

**CASEY:** Name one of those communities.

**RILEY:** The Kuhkenah Network, K-Net, serving First Nations communities in northern Ontario. Their locally managed network infrastructure maintained internal connectivity between communities during the Rogers outage because their routing didn't depend entirely on Rogers' backbone. They've been operating community-controlled telecommunications infrastructure since 1994 — over three decades — serving some of the most remote communities in Canada. If First Nations in northwestern Ontario can sustain community-controlled networks for thirty years, the idea that Cariboo communities can't manage basic local services seems frankly patronizing.

**CASEY:** K-Net is a genuinely impressive operation, and I'll grant you that example. But K-Net also receives sustained federal funding through Indigenous Services Canada, employs professional technical staff — not volunteers — and has had three decades to build institutional knowledge. They're not a counterexample to the expertise problem; they're an illustration of what it takes to actually solve it. Sustained public funding, professional staffing, and decades of organizational development. If you're advocating for that level of investment in Cariboo community infrastructure, I might actually agree with you. But that's a radically different proposal from "let's set up a Nextcloud server and a mesh network for seventy-five thousand dollars."

**RILEY:** You're right that K-Net had significant public investment, and I think that's actually the appropriate model. Rural digital infrastructure deserves public funding the same way rural electrification did in the 1930s and 40s. The Rural Electrification Administration in the United States didn't tell communities to just buy from private utilities or go without — it provided federal financing for community-owned electrical cooperatives. By 1953, over ninety percent of American farms had electricity, up from eleven percent in 1935. That model of public investment in community-controlled infrastructure transformed rural America. We need the equivalent for digital infrastructure, and Universal Broadband Fund dollars from the federal government are a start, but they're focused almost entirely on connectivity, not on the application and services layer where communities actually interact with technology daily.

**CASEY:** Now you're shifting from "communities can do this affordably on their own" to "we need a federal rural digitization program comparable to the Rural Electrification Administration." Those are fundamentally different arguments, Riley. The REA worked because the federal government committed four billion dollars over two decades — adjusted for inflation, that's roughly fifty to sixty billion in today's dollars — and because electricity is a standardized commodity. You plug in a toaster and it works the same whether your co-op is in Montana or Maine. Digital services aren't standardized. They change constantly, they require ongoing maintenance, and they interact with external systems in complex ways. The REA analogy is inspiring, but the engineering realities are completely different.

**RILEY:** The engineering is different, but the principle is identical: essential infrastructure shouldn't be controlled exclusively by distant corporations extracting value from rural communities. And the standardization problem is actually being solved. Open-source platforms are converging on common interfaces and interoperability standards. The ActivityPub protocol, which powers Mastodon and other federated social platforms, demonstrates that distributed community-run services can communicate seamlessly with each other. Every community doesn't need to build from scratch — they can join federated networks that provide both local control and global connectivity.

**CASEY:** ActivityPub is a nice protocol, but Mastodon's total active monthly user base peaked at roughly two and a half million in early 2023 and has since declined, according to Mastodon's own published statistics. Meanwhile, the platforms it's supposedly replacing have billions of users. Federation is technically elegant and practically marginal. Real resilience for rural communities means ensuring reliable access to the services people actually use — government portals, banking systems, telehealth platforms, supply chain tools — none of which are going to run on community-hosted infrastructure regardless of how good your Proxmox cluster is.

**RILEY:** You're right that nobody's self-hosting their bank. But you're conflating two different things. I'm not arguing communities should replace every external service — I'm arguing they should control the layer they can control. Local file storage, local communication tools, local backup systems, local network infrastructure. That foundation means when external services fail or become extractive, the community has fallback options and negotiating leverage. It's the difference between depending on a single supplier with no alternative and having genuine choices. Rural electrical cooperatives don't generate all their own power — many of them purchase wholesale from larger utilities — but their ownership structure means they negotiate from strength rather than begging for service.

**CASEY:** I hear you drawing a distinction between full replacement and strategic local capacity, and I think that's where your argument is strongest. But I want to push back on the "negotiating leverage" framing, because it assumes tech companies care whether a community of five hundred people threatens to leave Google Workspace. They don't. Google's enterprise division serves over nine million paying organizations. The Cariboo is a rounding error on a rounding error. Leverage requires scale, and individual rural communities don't have it.

**RILEY:** Individually, no. But collectively, rural Canada represents roughly six and a half million people, about eighteen percent of the national population. If rural communities organized around shared technology infrastructure the way agricultural producers organized around marketing boards, the collective purchasing power and political voice would be substantial. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities already advocates on digital infrastructure issues. Imagine a national rural technology cooperative that negotiated bulk licensing, shared technical resources, and provided alternatives to corporate lock-in. That's not fantasy — it's the co-operative model that rural Canada literally pioneered. Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Agropur, Mountain Equipment Co-op before it went corporate — rural communities have a century of experience building exactly these kinds of institutions.

**CASEY:** I'll give you this, Riley — the co-operative framing is the most compelling version of your argument, because it's grounded in institutions rural communities actually built and sustained. But co-operatives also have a mixed record. You mentioned MEC, which collapsed under governance failures and was sold to a private equity firm. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool converted to a publicly traded corporation in 1996 and eventually merged into Viterra, then got acquired by Glencore. Co-operative structures face constant pressure to either scale up and lose their community character or stay small and struggle with sustainability. A national rural technology co-operative would face exactly those same tensions.

**RILEY:** Those failures are real, but they're failures of specific governance decisions, not of the co-operative model itself. The Desjardins Group in Quebec is a financial co-operative with over seven million members and three hundred and sixty billion dollars in assets, and it's remained member-owned since 1900. Credit unions across BC — including ones serving Cariboo communities — have operated successfully for decades. The model works when governance structures are robust. And honestly, Casey, what's the alternative you're proposing? Permanent dependence on corporations that have demonstrated repeatedly they'll raise prices, discontinue services, and harvest user data the moment it's profitable to do so? Google has killed over two hundred products and services since 2006 according to the "Killed by Google" tracker. That's the "reliable" partner you're defending.

**CASEY:** I'm not defending Google's product graveyard — I'm pointing out that the alternative you're proposing has its own graveyard of failed community technology projects that nobody maintains a catchy website for. But I'll concede this: permanent, unmitigated corporate dependency isn't acceptable either. The question isn't whether communities should build technical capacity — I agree they should — it's whether that capacity should manifest as operational infrastructure or as institutional knowledge and negotiating power.

**RILEY:** Why not both? Start with institutional knowledge — digital literacy programs, community technology training, open-source skill building. That's low cost, low risk, and immediately valuable. Then, as capacity develops, pilot small-scale local services in areas where the privacy and cost benefits are clearest. File storage and backup, where data sensitivity matters and the technology is mature. Local communication tools for emergency coordination, where independence from external networks could literally save lives. Build from successes rather than trying to deploy a comprehensive platform on day one. That's not romantic idealism — it's iterative development, which is supposedly how the tech industry claims everything should work.

**CASEY:** Iterative development also means being honest about when an iteration fails and having the discipline to shut it down rather than pouring more resources into a sunk cost. That's the part community projects struggle with — nobody wants to be the person who says "this isn't working, let's go back to Google Drive." But I'll meet you partway. Building technical literacy and piloting low-risk local services is a reasonable first step. I'm just not convinced it inevitably leads to the community-controlled infrastructure vision you're describing. It might just as easily lead to communities concluding that corporate services, for all their flaws, offer better value for most use cases.

**RILEY:** And if communities reach that conclusion with full knowledge and genuine alternatives, that's a legitimate choice made from a position of strength rather than ignorance. That's the resilience I'm actually arguing for — not a specific technology stack, but the capacity to make informed decisions about your own digital future. A community that understands what self-hosting involves and chooses corporate services anyway is in a fundamentally different position than one that uses corporate services because it doesn't know alternatives exist.

**CASEY:** That's a distinction I can respect, even though I suspect we'd still disagree about where most communities would land after going through that process. You'd predict a groundswell of local infrastructure enthusiasm. I'd predict most communities would evaluate the trade-offs and opt for better-negotiated corporate contracts with some local backup capacity for emergencies. But either outcome is better than the current default of passive, uninformed dependency.

**RILEY:** I'll take that as a partial victory. And for what it's worth, your insistence on rigorous cost accounting and realistic assessment of volunteer capacity has genuinely sharpened how I'd pitch this to an actual community council. "Build local infrastructure" is a bumper sticker. "Build technical literacy, pilot low-risk services, develop regional cooperation, and create genuine alternatives to corporate dependency" is a plan.

**CASEY:** Glad I could help you workshop your grant application. But seriously — we'd love to hear from listeners who've actually tried community technology projects, whether they succeeded or crashed and burned. Send us your stories at feedback at cariboo signals dot c-a.

**RILEY:** Whether you're ready to set up a mesh network tomorrow or you think we should negotiate a better deal with the cloud providers we've got, we want to hear about it. Hope you had a great weekend, everyone.
