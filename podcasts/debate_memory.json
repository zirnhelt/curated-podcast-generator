    "central_question": "Should rural communities invest in self-hosted, locally controlled technology infrastructure, or are they better served relying on centralized cloud services?",
    "riley_position": "Rural communities should build local technology infrastructure because costs have dropped dramatically, it provides genuine resilience against corporate failures, and communities can pool resources regionally to share expertise and costs.",
    "riley_key_evidence": [
      "Fiber installation costs dropped 60% between 2015-2024",
      "Town of Olds, Alberta delivers gigabit service for $60/month via municipal fiber cooperative O-Net",
      "Kuhkenah Network (K-Net) maintained connectivity during 2022 Rogers outage serving First Nations communities for 30+ years"
    ],
    "casey_position": "Self-hosted infrastructure is impractical for small rural communities due to high hidden costs, expertise requirements, and maintenance burdens that advocates consistently undercount.",
    "casey_key_evidence": [
      "Olds O-Net required $40+ million investment ($4,400 per resident) with ongoing debt servicing",
      "Qualified Linux systems administrator costs $65-85k annually - unsustainable for small communities",
      "Rogers 2022 outage affecting 12 million people shows even billion-dollar companies with thousands of engineers fail catastrophically"
    ],
    "resolution": "They reached partial agreement that building technical literacy and piloting low-risk local services is reasonable, while disagreeing on whether this would lead to widespread community infrastructure adoption or better-negotiated corporate contracts.",
