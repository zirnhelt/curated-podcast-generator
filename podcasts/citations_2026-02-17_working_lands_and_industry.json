    "description": "Riley and Casey explore technology and society in rural communities. Today's focus: Working Lands & Industry.\n\nNEWS ROUNDUP: We break down [Business Insider] A Ukrainian drone pilot found a hidden Russian arsenal, only to discover it was filled with horses and old cars and [GN AI ML Infrastructure] How clean energy infrastructure can catch up with the AI boom, plus 1 more stories, and explore what these developments mean for communities like ours.\n\nRURAL CONNECTIONS: Whether increasing technology dependence in resource industries like ranching, forestry, and mining will ultimately benefit or harm rural working communities in the Cariboo region. Topics include: Battery reliability and maintenance infrastructure gaps, Competition between data centers and resource industries for electricity, Local technical capacity and repair capabilities, Economic diversification versus traditional industry stability, Technology as amplification versus replacement of human expertise.\n\nHosts: Riley (Tech optimist with an engineering background) and Casey (Community-first skeptic of tech promises).\n\nSources discussed:\n1.
