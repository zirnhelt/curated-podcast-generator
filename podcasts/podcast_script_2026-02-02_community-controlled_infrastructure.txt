**CASEY:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals, it's Monday, February 02, 2026. Today's theme is Community-Controlled Infrastructure — I'm Casey.

**RILEY:** And I'm Riley. We're looking at who really gets to build the digital backbone of rural communities, and what happens when big tech dollars clash with local needs.

**CASEY:** Let's start with what's happening in tech this week.

**SEGMENT 1: THE WEEK'S TECH**

**CASEY:** School District 73 in Kamloops just added a new accessible bus to their fleet, specifically designed to make field trips more equitable for students with mobility challenges. The district says this is part of a broader push to ensure all students can participate in experiential learning opportunities, regardless of physical barriers.

**RILEY:** Small infrastructure investments that actually reach kids — refreshing compared to some of the other numbers we're seeing.

**CASEY:** Speaking of numbers, Meta is doubling down on AI infrastructure with a $65 billion spending spree, though their revenue growth isn't quite keeping pace with these massive capital expenditures. Oracle isn't far behind, planning to raise $50 billion specifically for cloud infrastructure expansion.

**RILEY:** That's more money than most countries' entire GDP.

**CASEY:** Meanwhile, the real work of building AI applications got a reality check at Gemini's hackathon in Singapore, where developers discovered that creating functional AI tools in seven hours requires genuine technical skill, not just prompting and hoping. Participants found themselves doing actual coding, debugging, and systems integration.

**RILEY:** Turns out there's no shortcut to understanding how technology actually works.

**CASEY:** In acquisition news, Tarabut picked up Servable to build AI-native financial infrastructure across the Middle East and North Africa, while Arista Networks is positioning itself as critical infrastructure for the AI boom, focusing on the networking hardware that connects all these massive compute clusters. Arrow Electronics' earnings are being watched as a litmus test for AI infrastructure demand.

**RILEY:** The companies building the pipes often outlast the companies building the applications.

**CASEY:** Corning and Meta just secured a $6 billion alliance to supercharge fiber optic supply chains, which could actually trickle down to rural connectivity projects if the economics work out. Though NVIDIA's CEO clarified that the much-discussed $100 billion OpenAI investment was never actually a firm commitment. Budget discussions suggest tax holidays for foreign cloud companies as governments try to attract AI infrastructure investment.

**RILEY:** Classic Silicon Valley — big announcements, flexible commitments.

**CASEY:** And Indonesia just lifted its ban on Grok after getting new assurances from X Corp about content moderation. Even as AI companies promise the world, we're also seeing "AI layoffs" and concerns about "AI-washing" — companies claiming AI capabilities they don't actually have.

**RILEY:** Billions in infrastructure promises, reality checks on implementation, and questions about what actually reaches communities like ours.

**CASEY:** Coming up next, we'll explore that tension in depth.

**SEGMENT 2: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS - Community-Controlled Infrastructure**

**RILEY:** Here's what strikes me about those infrastructure numbers we just rattled off. Meta's $65 billion, Oracle's $50 billion — when you put that in perspective, Oracle's budget alone could buy every single person in British Columbia a brand new truck. Instead, it's going toward data centers that most rural communities will never directly benefit from.

**CASEY:** And that's the core issue with how we think about digital infrastructure. The conversation is always about scale — bigger server farms, faster connections between major cities, more computing power concentrated in fewer locations. But what if we flipped that model entirely?

**RILEY:** Right, because community-controlled infrastructure isn't just about ownership. It's about fundamentally different priorities. When a community controls its own digital infrastructure, the question isn't "how do we maximize shareholder returns?" It's "how do we serve local needs most effectively?"

**CASEY:** Take that Corning-Meta fiber partnership we mentioned. Six billion dollars to optimize fiber production for hyperscale data centers. That sounds like it should help rural connectivity, but the fiber they're developing is engineered for moving massive amounts of data between urban facilities, not for the last-mile challenges we face out here.

**RILEY:** It's like being excited that NASA is improving rocket fuel efficiency when what you really need is better roads. Sure, there might be some technological spillover eventually, but the primary research isn't aimed at solving your actual problems.

**CASEY:** This gets to the heart of what community-controlled infrastructure actually means. It's not just about who owns the cables and servers — it's about who gets to define the problems we're trying to solve and what solutions look like.

**RILEY:** And when external companies control those decisions, rural communities become an optimization problem rather than stakeholders. We get infrastructure designed for urban contexts and rural contexts get whatever adaptations are profitable enough to justify.

**CASEY:** Here's where it gets really interesting though. Some of the technology being developed for AI infrastructure could be incredibly powerful for community-controlled systems, if communities can access it on their own terms.

**RILEY:** How so?

**CASEY:** Edge computing hardware is becoming incredibly capable. The same processors designed to run AI models at the edge of corporate networks could handle most of the digital services a small town needs — local web hosting, document processing, communication tools, even AI applications tailored for local use.

**RILEY:** But accessing that hardware as a community rather than as a corporate customer means navigating completely different markets, support systems, and pricing structures.

**CASEY:** Exactly. When Arista Networks talks about being "critical infrastructure for the AI boom," they're thinking about selling networking equipment to Amazon and Google, not to the District of Wells or local First Nations governments. The hardware might be perfect for community use, but the business model assumes you're operating at enterprise scale.

**RILEY:** Which brings up an interesting contradiction in how we think about cybersecurity. There's all this concern about foreign interference in AI systems, about making sure America's AI infrastructure is secure and resilient. But secure from whom? And controlled by whom?

**CASEY:** Right, because when your internet infrastructure is entirely controlled by companies whose interests don't align with your community's needs, you're vulnerable in different ways. Maybe not to foreign government surveillance, but certainly to corporate decisions that could cut off your access or dramatically change your costs without any local input.

**RILEY:** It's like being worried about other countries reading your mail while voluntarily handing over all your letters to a private company that reserves the right to change delivery terms whenever they want.

**CASEY:** And here's the thing — some of the most robust cybersecurity comes from systems that don't need to phone home to distant servers for every operation. A community-owned fiber network that keeps local traffic local is inherently more secure than systems that route everything through centralized chokepoints.

**RILEY:** Though I'm sure there's a consultant somewhere working on "AI-enhanced community networks" that would somehow require constant cloud connectivity to function, completely defeating the purpose.

**CASEY:** Oh absolutely. "Your local network needs machine learning optimization from our global data centers to deliver the best user experience!" Because apparently a simple, reliable connection isn't good enough anymore — everything has to be "smart" and "optimized" and dependent on external services.

**RILEY:** But let's talk about what community-controlled AI infrastructure could actually look like, because I think there are some genuinely exciting possibilities if communities can cut through the marketing noise.

**CASEY:** The key insight is that most AI applications don't actually need the massive computing power that companies like Meta and Oracle are building toward. For things like language translation, document processing, educational tools, or local information services, you can run very capable AI models on hardware that a community could reasonably own and maintain.

**RILEY:** And when you're running those models locally, you get to make different tradeoffs. Maybe you prioritize data privacy over cutting-edge performance. Maybe you choose open-source models that you can inspect and modify over proprietary systems that promise better results but lock you into vendor relationships.

**CASEY:** Those are choices communities should get to make rather than having them imposed by distant corporations. And local infrastructure opens up possibilities that centralized systems can't match — AI tools trained on local languages and dialects, services that work even when internet connectivity is spotty, applications designed around local workflows rather than generic urban assumptions.

**RILEY:** Plus there's the governance aspect. When your AI infrastructure is physically located in your community and managed by people you know, you have actual oversight over what's happening with your data. You're not just trusting corporate privacy policies that could change at any time.

**CASEY:** But getting there requires communities to push back against some pretty entrenched narratives — that bigger is always better, that centralized systems are always more efficient, that communities can't possibly understand technology well enough to manage it themselves.

**RILEY:** Which is particularly ironic given how often centralized systems fail rural communities specifically because they don't understand our contexts. How many times have we seen urban-designed solutions that completely fall apart when applied to rural geography, rural economics, rural social structures?

**CASEY:** Too many to count. And yet we're supposed to believe that AI infrastructure will be different, that this time the big tech companies will definitely consider rural needs in their planning process.

**RILEY:** Sure, right after they finish eliminating traffic congestion with autonomous vehicles and solving the housing crisis with virtual reality.

**CASEY:** But here's what gives me hope — the technology barriers to community-controlled infrastructure are actually decreasing every year. Setting up local fiber networks, running community data centers, deploying local AI services — none of this requires PhD-level expertise anymore.

**RILEY:** The barriers now are more about access to equipment at reasonable prices, understanding what's actually possible versus what's just marketing hype, and having the political and economic structures to support community ownership.

**CASEY:** And those are problems communities have solved before in other contexts. Rural communities have a long history of building cooperative infrastructure when market solutions don't work — rural electrification, telephone cooperatives, credit unions, agricultural cooperatives.

**RILEY:** The difference now is the speed at which the technological landscape is changing and the scale of investment flowing toward centralized alternatives. When Oracle is trying to raise $50 billion as quickly as possible, there's not much time for thoughtful community engagement about what infrastructure actually serves local needs.

**CASEY:** Which means communities need to be proactive about understanding their options and advocating for their interests in infrastructure planning processes. When governments are offering tax incentives to attract AI infrastructure investment, rural communities should be asking what we get out of those deals.

**RILEY:** Not just accepting vague promises about economic spillover effects. If companies want public support for their infrastructure projects, they should be providing concrete commitments about rural access and community benefits.

**CASEY:** Because ultimately, the infrastructure decisions being made now determine what's possible for communities over the next decade. If we let it all be controlled by distant corporations optimizing for urban markets and enterprise customers, we'll spend years arguing about digital equity instead of exploring what's possible when communities control their own technological futures.

**RILEY:** And some of the current infrastructure investments could genuinely help if communities can figure out how to access them. That fiber production partnership between Corning and Meta might drive down material costs enough to make community-owned networks more feasible, even if that wasn't the original intention.

**CASEY:** The competition between networking equipment companies could lead to more standardized, interoperable hardware that communities can mix and match rather than being locked into single-vendor systems. The challenge is staying informed about what's actually available and pushing for community needs to be considered in the development process.

**RILEY:** Which brings us back to that hackathon story from Singapore. The developers who actually succeeded were the ones who understood the underlying technology, not the ones who believed the marketing about AI tools that work like magic. The same principle applies to infrastructure — communities that succeed are the ones that invest in real technical understanding.

**CASEY:** Not necessarily becoming experts in every detail, but understanding enough to evaluate proposals, ask the right questions, and make informed decisions about what technologies actually serve community needs versus what just sounds impressive in presentations.

**RILEY:** And building local capacity to manage and maintain whatever infrastructure communities do invest in. Because when your internet goes down at 2 AM, you don't want to be calling a support center in another country where the primary goal is convincing you to upgrade to a more expensive service plan.

**CASEY:** So what would genuinely community-controlled AI infrastructure look like in practice? If we could wave a magic wand and redirect some of those billions toward rural communities instead of just hyperscale data centers?

**RILEY:** I think it starts with local computing and storage capabilities integrated into existing community infrastructure. Instead of building separate data centers, you're putting computing equipment in the same buildings that house libraries, community centers, municipal offices — shared power, shared maintenance, shared governance.

**CASEY:** And the applications would be different too. Instead of trying to build the next ChatGPT, you're focusing on AI tools that serve specific community needs — translation services for Indigenous languages, educational applications that work with local curricula, document processing that handles local government workflows.

**RILEY:** Plus the infrastructure would be designed for resilience rather than maximum efficiency. Maybe you have redundant systems across multiple community buildings rather than one optimized data center. Maybe you prioritize equipment that can be repaired locally over cutting-edge performance that requires specialized support.

**CASEY:** Those are tradeoffs that make sense when your goal is serving a specific community rather than maximizing return on investment. And they lead to different technical choices about what equipment to buy, how to configure networks, what software to run.

**RILEY:** But getting there requires communities to engage with these infrastructure decisions while they're still being made, not after the fact. The window for influencing how AI infrastructure develops is narrowing as more investment flows toward centralized systems.

**CASEY:** And it requires pushing back against the narrative that communities should just be grateful for whatever digital infrastructure they can get, rather than having legitimate input into what gets built and how it operates.

**RILEY:** Because the alternative is spending the next decade dealing with the consequences of infrastructure decisions made without community input — digital systems that don't serve local needs, dependency on external companies that can change terms at will, and missed opportunities to build something better.

**CASEY:** But the good news is that the technical foundations for community-controlled alternatives are getting more accessible every year. The main barriers now are political and economic, not technological. And those are problems communities have proven they can solve when they have the information and the will to act.

**RILEY:** So maybe our role is helping communities understand what's actually possible, what the real tradeoffs are, and how to evaluate infrastructure proposals based on community priorities rather than corporate marketing materials.

**CASEY:** And connecting communities that are working on similar challenges, because a lot of the solutions to community-controlled infrastructure will come from communities learning from each other's successes and failures.

**RILEY:** We'd love to hear your thoughts on community-controlled infrastructure — what's working in your area, what obstacles you're facing, and what questions you'd like us to explore further. You can reach us through our website.
