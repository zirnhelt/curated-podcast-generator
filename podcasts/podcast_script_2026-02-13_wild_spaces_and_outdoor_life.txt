**RILEY:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals, it's Friday, February thirteenth, twenty twenty-six. Today's theme is Wild Spaces and Outdoor Life — I'm Riley.

**CASEY:** And I'm Casey. From battery tech that could power remote cabins to the tools helping us explore backcountry responsibly, we're looking at how technology meets wilderness.

**RILEY:** Let's get into the headlines.

**NEWS ROUNDUP**

**RILEY:** Hanwha and Morrison's Chrysalis are partnering for three-point-five gigawatts of solar and storage across North America — enough clean energy to power roughly two million homes. The partnership combines Hanwha's manufacturing capabilities with Morrison's project development expertise for utility-scale installations.

**CASEY:** Distributed microgrids for remote communities would be the real game-changer here.

**CASEY:** A growing coalition of energy analysts is making the case that electrifying everything — transportation, heating, industrial processes — now makes pure economic sense, not just environmental sense. The argument hinges on renewable electricity becoming so cheap that switching away from fossil fuels pays for itself across nearly every sector.

**RILEY:** The economics are shifting faster than rural infrastructure built around propane and diesel can adapt.

**RILEY:** Rivian says they're targeting twenty to twenty-five thousand R-Two deliveries this year. The R-Two is their more affordable electric pickup, starting around forty-five thousand dollars, designed as a smaller, lighter alternative to the flagship R-One-S truck.

**CASEY:** That price point could work for fleet buyers like forestry contractors, though charging infrastructure remains the bigger bottleneck.

**CASEY:** The US is tightening restrictions on Chinese components in clean energy projects seeking federal tax credits. New rules target solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage systems with significant Chinese content, part of a broader push to build domestic clean energy supply chains.

**RILEY:** Supply chain nationalism may slow deployment short-term, but it could mean more resilient rural energy projects down the road.

**RILEY:** Volkswagen unveiled their split-cell bus concept — a modular electric vehicle designed to handle both passenger transport and cargo hauling. The interior reconfigures quickly between modes, built on VW's electric platform. Think Swiss Army knife for commercial fleets.

**CASEY:** Perfect for small communities that need one vehicle wearing multiple hats across the week.

**CASEY:** Researchers have developed a new recyclable ink for three-D printing that tackles one of the technology's biggest sustainability headaches. The ink can be dissolved and reused multiple times without losing its printing properties, potentially cutting plastic waste from failed prints and prototypes dramatically.

**RILEY:** That could make three-D printing far more viable for rural repair shops where material costs really matter.

**RILEY:** Also of note — Hackaday covered a physics experiment on weighing electrons using quantum techniques. It's pure science, but the precision measurement methods could eventually inform better sensors for environmental monitoring and agricultural applications.

**CASEY:** Fundamental research like that has a way of surfacing in unexpected places years later.

**CASEY:** And in the maker world, MyMiniFactory has acquired Thingiverse, the massive three-D printing file repository that's been plagued by technical problems. MyMiniFactory says they plan to revitalize the platform and better serve the community that depends on it.

**RILEY:** A healthy Thingiverse would be a real asset for remote makers who rely on shared designs.

**CASEY:** That wraps our headlines. Next, let's turn to an organization doing meaningful work in the region.

**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**

**RILEY:** Today we want to highlight the Cariboo Chilcotin Conservation Society. They've been running environmental education programs since nineteen ninety-six — Water Wise, Waste Wise, school field trips, and their Skates for All program, which gets donated skates to kids who need them. Right now they're especially looking for kids' sizes seven through ten. You can drop off donations at Total Ice or the Cariboo Memorial Recreation Complex.

**CASEY:** They're one of those organizations that quietly shape how the next generation relates to the land around them — really glad they're out there.

**RILEY:** So let's dig into today's bigger question. How is technology actually changing our relationship with wild spaces — and who benefits?

**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS — Wild Spaces and Outdoor Life**

**CASEY:** So here's the argument I want to make today. We're in the middle of a fundamental shift in how people access, experience, and stay safe in wilderness — and rural communities like ours are caught between two forces. On one side, technology is making backcountry experiences safer, more accessible, and more data-rich than ever. On the other, that same technology risks creating new dependencies, new inequities, and a subtly different relationship with the land itself. The question isn't whether technology belongs in wild spaces. It's already there. The question is whether communities that actually live alongside wilderness get to shape how it's integrated — or whether that gets decided for them in offices a thousand kilometres away.

**RILEY:** And I think the place to start building that argument is with power — literally, electrical power — because nothing happens in the backcountry without it anymore, and the options are changing fast. Researchers at HKUST recently published work on calcium-ion batteries that caught my eye. Calcium is abundant and cheap compared to lithium. Their batteries are stable, safe, and don't require the rare earth elements that make current battery tech expensive and environmentally messy.

**CASEY:** And the reason that matters for this conversation is that the value proposition is completely different from what Silicon Valley optimizes for. Most battery press coverage obsesses over energy density and charging speed — metrics that matter for phones and electric sports cars. But for wilderness applications — powering backcountry huts, emergency shelters, search and rescue communication relays — you might actually prefer a battery that's cheap, stable, and won't catch fire when a tree falls on it.

**RILEY:** Which is exactly the kind of distinction that gets lost when the people designing these systems have never had to think about, say, keeping a remote weather station running at minus thirty through a week-long power outage.

**CASEY:** Right. And this gets to the heart of my argument. The technology itself is often impressive. It's the assumptions baked into its design that create problems. Take portable power stations — the EcoFlow DELTA Pro Three and its competitors. These have become standard equipment for backcountry researchers and serious outdoor operations. Wildlife researchers run camera traps and sensor networks for months without maintenance visits. Forest fire monitoring systems operate independently of the grid. Search and rescue teams set up communication hubs in places that had no infrastructure an hour before.

**RILEY:** All genuinely valuable. But I love the trajectory we're on as a culture, where "roughing it" has evolved from "no technology whatsoever" to "I only brought the two-thousand-watt portable power station, not the four-thousand-watt one." Lewis and Clark would be baffled.

**CASEY:** They'd also be baffled by Gore-Tex, to be fair. But you're touching on something real. There's a tension between electrifying wilderness experiences and preserving what makes wilderness meaningful in the first place. Some backcountry areas are already seeing conflicts — people who want to preserve the low-tech experience clashing with people flying drones for photography, riding electric bikes for access, or relying on satellite communicators for safety.

**RILEY:** It's the old philosophical question about whether building a trail destroys the wilderness experience or democratizes it. Except now the trail is digital infrastructure, and instead of a local trail crew deciding where it goes, the route is being plotted by product managers at Garmin and DJI.

**CASEY:** And that's exactly the power dynamic I want to focus on. Because the accessibility gains are real and important. GPS and satellite communicators have genuinely made backcountry activities safer for people who might not have decades of navigation experience. Electric mountain bikes let people with mobility limitations access terrain that was previously off-limits. Real-time weather data means fewer people get caught in storms they couldn't have predicted.

**RILEY:** Nobody reasonable argues against those outcomes. The friction starts when you look at who controls the systems delivering them — and what happens when they fail or when the subscription lapses.

**CASEY:** Exactly. And this creates a digital equity problem that mirrors what we see with rural broadband, but transposed into the outdoors. A decent satellite communicator costs several hundred dollars plus monthly fees. A quality portable power station runs a thousand dollars or more. An electric bike suitable for backcountry terrain starts around three thousand. If safety and access increasingly depend on having these devices, then wilderness experience becomes stratified by technology access.

**RILEY:** Though to push back slightly — backcountry recreation has always had significant gear costs. Quality boots, tents, avalanche safety equipment. None of that is cheap either.

**CASEY:** True, and that's a fair challenge. But there's a critical difference. Traditional backcountry gear degrades gracefully. A ten-year-old tent might be less waterproof, but it still shelters you from rain. A ten-year-old GPS unit that no longer receives software updates might give you dangerously inaccurate positions — or just brick itself entirely. You can patch a torn jacket in the field with a needle and thread. You cannot field-repair a satellite communicator with a multi-tool and good intentions.

**RILEY:** So the failure mode is fundamentally different. Analog gear gets worse slowly. Digital gear works perfectly until it doesn't work at all.

**CASEY:** Which means resilience planning looks completely different. And this is where I think rural and Indigenous communities have something essential to contribute — because they've been building resilient relationships with these landscapes for generations, long before anyone showed up with a lithium battery and a Starlink terminal.

**RILEY:** Traditional ecological knowledge often captures exactly the kind of nuance that sensors miss. Subtle changes in animal behavior, in vegetation patterns, in how water moves through a drainage. The kind of information that requires deep, sustained attention to a specific place.

**CASEY:** And the most effective systems I've seen combine both. Avalanche Canada is a great example. Their forecasting network relies heavily on volunteer observers using traditional snow science techniques alongside modern monitoring equipment. Local knowledge about specific terrain features, historical slide paths, and microclimatic patterns gets integrated with sensor data and satellite imagery. It's a hybrid model — technology amplifying distributed local expertise rather than replacing it.

**RILEY:** That's a useful template. But it only works when the local experts have a seat at the table, and when the technology is designed to accommodate their knowledge rather than override it.

**CASEY:** Which brings us to infrastructure sovereignty. If the satellite systems, GPS networks, and communication platforms are all controlled by external corporations or foreign governments, then communities don't truly control their own access to the landscapes they live in. Your ability to safely navigate your own backyard depends on decisions made in boardrooms you'll never enter.

**RILEY:** I keep thinking about the scale mismatch. You've got a town of eight hundred people whose entire economic and cultural identity is tied to the surrounding wilderness, and their safety infrastructure depends on decisions made by a company with forty thousand employees optimizing for a global market. The town isn't even a rounding error in that company's user base.

**CASEY:** It's like ordering a custom pair of boots and getting whatever size the factory was already making that day. The product might be excellent on its own terms — just not built for your feet.

**RILEY:** So what does a better model look like? Community-owned infrastructure for outdoor access and safety?

**CASEY:** Some of it's already emerging. Shared equipment libraries where communities pool expensive gear. Local weather monitoring networks maintained by residents who understand their specific microclimate. Volunteer-run communication relays that don't depend on a single corporate provider. The Cariboo Chilcotin Conservation Society we spotlighted earlier is part of this ecosystem — building the human knowledge base alongside whatever technology arrives.

**RILEY:** And I think there's something important about preserving multiple ways of knowing and navigating these spaces. Not putting everything in the technological basket, but also not rejecting useful tools out of nostalgia.

**CASEY:** Right. Redundancy isn't just a technical principle — it's a cultural one. If the only people who can navigate backcountry safely are the ones carrying functioning electronics, we've created a single point of failure for an entire relationship with the land.

**RILEY:** That VW split-cell bus concept from our news segment is actually an interesting lens here. The modular thinking — one platform, multiple configurations — makes real sense for communities with small populations and wildly seasonal demand. During summer it's passenger transport for trail crews and tourists. Fire season, it's hauling equipment and supplies. Winter, it's a mobile command post for avalanche monitoring. You can't justify a dedicated vehicle for each role in a community of five hundred people, but you can justify one that adapts.

**CASEY:** Though I'll note the irony that this flexibility is being pitched as an innovation by a multinational automaker, when rural people have been making one truck do seventeen jobs since trucks were invented. Somewhere in the Chilcotin there's a nineteen ninety-four Ford with a homemade flatbed conversion that's been doing exactly this for three decades.

**RILEY:** Fair point. Maybe the innovation isn't the concept — it's applying it with electric drivetrain efficiency and modern safety standards.

**CASEY:** And that's really the productive framing for all of this. Technology integration into wild spaces works best when it takes seriously what rural communities already know — about resilience, about multi-use design, about maintaining deep relationships with specific landscapes — and builds on that foundation rather than paving over it.

**RILEY:** So to pull the threads together: we're arguing that the technology arriving in wilderness spaces is often genuinely useful, but it carries assumptions about who uses it, how it fails, and who controls it that don't map well onto rural reality. The communities closest to these landscapes need to be shaping adoption, not just receiving it.

**CASEY:** And the stakes are higher than weekend recreation. For communities where the outdoors is home, livelihood, and cultural identity all at once, how technology integrates with wild spaces isn't a consumer preference. It's a question about sovereignty and self-determination.

**RILEY:** Climate change raises the urgency, too. Fire seasons are longer and more intense. Weather patterns are shifting. Traditional seasonal rhythms are disrupting. Technology that helps communities adapt to those changes is genuinely needed — but only if it's designed with, not just for, the people living through them.

**CASEY:** The most resilient path forward probably looks less like a Silicon Valley product launch and more like that Avalanche Canada model — layered systems, local knowledge at the center, technology as amplifier rather than replacement, and communities retaining meaningful control over the tools they depend on.

**RILEY:** Not a rejection of technology in the backcountry, and not uncritical adoption either. Something more like a negotiation — on terms that make sense for the people who actually live here.

**CASEY:** We'd love to hear how technology is showing up in your own outdoor experiences. Drop us a line at feedback at cariboo signals dot c-a.

**RILEY:** Enjoy your weekend, and get outside if you can.
