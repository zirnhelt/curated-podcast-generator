**WELCOME & INTRODUCTIONS**

**RILEY:** Welcome to CARE-ih-boo Signals, an AI-generated review of the latest tech news and ideas that impact our rural communities. It's Monday, February sixteenth, 2026. Coming to you from the CARE-ih-boo, on the traditional and unceded territories of the She-KWEP-em, Sill-KOH-tin, and Dah-KELH nations. Today's theme is Arts, Culture & Digital Storytelling — I'm Riley.

**CASEY:** And I'm Casey. We're exploring how rural communities tell their stories in a digital age, and what happens when those narratives collide with technology platforms and social media.

**RILEY:** Here's what's making headlines.

**NEWS ROUNDUP**

**RILEY:** We're starting with local coverage from the Keh-NEL CARE-ih-boo Observer about a vigil held in Langley City for Tumbler Ridge. The community gathered to show solidarity after last week's tragic events, with organizers using social media and live video to extend support across provincial boundaries — a vivid example of digital tools reshaping how geographically dispersed rural communities express collective grief.

**CASEY:** A powerful demonstration that distance doesn't have to mean isolation anymore.

**CASEY:** From Kenya, The Guardian reports on the restoration of a colonial-era library in Nairobi that's being "given back to the people." The McMillan Memorial Library project paired digital archiving with community-controlled access, with local groups and preservation specialists working together to ensure the collection serves neighbourhood needs rather than purely external research interests — prioritizing community ownership of both physical and digital cultural assets.

**RILEY:** That community-controlled model for digital archives could be genuinely transformative for Indigenous knowledge preservation here.

**RILEY:** XDA Developers is advising against purchasing Steam Machines, even for older PC builds. Valve's gaming hardware still assumes high-speed unlimited broadband, with required downloads regularly exceeding fifty gigabytes per title — bandwidth that simply doesn't exist in much of the CARE-ih-boo. Retro gaming setups or local multiplayer options remain far more practical for connectivity-limited households.

**CASEY:** Yet another product designed as if everyone lives within range of a fibre optic line.

**CASEY:** CFJC Today Kam-loops reports that the Thompson-Nicola Regional District is extending their 911 dispatch contract with the Regional District of Central Okanagan while awaiting details on NextGen emergency services. The transition to IP-based emergency communications promises better location tracking and multimedia capability, but rural officials are requesting full cost projections before committing — concerned about service reliability during network outages in areas where cell coverage remains patchy.

**RILEY:** Smart to demand those numbers upfront — too many rural jurisdictions get locked into upgrade costs they can't sustain.

**RILEY:** Also from XDA Developers, an analysis suggesting DDR4 memory has become the sweet spot for budget PC builds in 2026. With DDR5 pricing still at a premium, DDR4 performance handles most computing tasks including content creation and streaming. For rural creators working within tight budgets, that means a viable entry point into digital media production without paying for cutting-edge specs they don't need.

**CASEY:** Refreshing to see tech guidance that actually acknowledges not everyone has an unlimited hardware budget.

**CASEY:** The 100 Mile Free Press features ranch musings from a CARE-ih-boo rancher's visit to Cuba. The piece explores agricultural practices and rural community structures through cross-cultural comparison — not explicitly about technology, but it highlights how storytelling and cultural exchange sustain rural identity, the kind of narrative that increasingly finds its audience through digital platforms and social media.

**RILEY:** Those cross-cultural rural stories consistently find engaged audiences when they reach the right online communities.

**RILEY:** The Marginalian offers philosophical reflections on "How to Live and How to Die," drawing on literature and wisdom traditions around mortality and meaning. It represents the kind of longform, reflective content that thrives in digital spaces where audiences are hungry for depth beyond the typical social media scroll.

**CASEY:** A good reminder that not all digital storytelling has to be short-form or algorithmic.

**CASEY:** Rounding things out: researchers have developed recyclable ink for 3D printing, a potential waste-reduction breakthrough for community maker spaces and workshops. And The Tyee is questioning whether BC will axe FireSmart funding in tomorrow's budget — a program many CARE-ih-boo communities depend on for wildfire mitigation.

**RILEY:** Those budget decisions will have direct impact on community preparedness well before fire season hits.

**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**

**CASEY:** Today we're highlighting CARE-ih-boo Chill-KOH-tin Partners for Literacy. They offer free adult literacy, ESL, and digital literacy programs across the region, recognizing that meaningful participation in digital storytelling starts with foundational reading and writing skills. Their work helps community members engage with online cultural resources and contribute their own stories to digital platforms. You can learn more at caribooliteracy.com.

**RILEY:** Foundational work — you can't tell your story digitally if the basics aren't there first.

**CASEY:** Now let's get into the bigger questions around how rural communities are navigating digital storytelling in an increasingly complicated online landscape.

**DEEP DIVE: CARE-IH-BOO CONNECTIONS — Arts, Culture & Digital Storytelling**

**RILEY:** Casey, I want to start with something that struck me in today's coverage. The Tumbler Ridge vigil and the Nairobi library project sit at opposite ends of a spectrum — one is spontaneous community expression amplified by social media, the other is deliberate, structured cultural preservation using digital tools. But both represent rural communities deciding how their stories get told in digital spaces. And five years ago, neither of those projects would have been technically feasible at the scale we're seeing. I think we're in a genuine inflection point for rural digital storytelling.

**CASEY:** I'd agree it's an inflection point, but I'm not sure it's the hopeful one you're describing. The Tyee's reporting on the Tumbler Ridge shooter's online activity shows the other side of that coin — every post, every interaction, every algorithm-driven recommendation gets scraped and recontextualized after a tragedy. Rural people tend to share more personal information online because they're operating with small-town social norms. But digital platforms don't function like small towns. They're surveillance architectures with global reach, and rural users are often the least equipped to navigate that exposure.

**RILEY:** That's a real concern, but I don't think we can let worst-case scenarios close the door on tools that are already producing measurable cultural outcomes. Take the First Nations Technology Council's work in BC — their 2024 Digital Equity report documented 47 community-led digital heritage projects across the province, with 31 in communities under 5,000 people. These aren't academic experiments. The Líl̓wat Nation near Pemberton digitized over 1,200 hours of elder recordings between 2022 and 2025, using metadata tagging that lets community members search by speaker, topic, season, and ceremony type. That's a level of cultural accessibility that physical archives could never provide.

**CASEY:** I don't dispute the value of that work, but let's talk about what makes it possible. The Líl̓wat project had backing from the First Nations Technology Council, partnership with Simon Fraser University's digital humanities lab, and federal Heritage Canada funding totaling over $340,000 across three years. That's not a model most CARE-ih-boo communities can replicate. The Ulkatcho First Nation, for example, has been trying to digitize their own oral histories since 2019, and as of last year they'd completed fewer than 80 hours because they're relying on a single part-time coordinator and donated equipment. Scale matters, and so does sustained funding.

**RILEY:** You're right that resources are uneven, but the cost curve is moving fast in the right direction. UBC's Oral History in the Digital Age project — which specifically targets rural and Northern BC communities — provides turnkey recording kits and cloud storage at under $2,000 per community. They've partnered with 23 communities since 2023 and documented over 400 traditional stories. The technical training takes less than a day. We're not talking about asking every community to build a digital humanities lab from scratch.

**CASEY:** And who controls those 400 stories once they're in UBC's cloud infrastructure? This is the pattern I keep seeing. Academic institutions arrive with grant money and good intentions, extract cultural knowledge under the banner of preservation, then move on when the research cycle ends. Communities get left with broken links and inaccessible archives. The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami flagged exactly this problem in their 2023 report on research ethics — they found that over 60 percent of Arctic cultural digitization projects initiated between 2010 and 2020 had no data repatriation plan when funding expired.

**RILEY:** That's a damning statistic, and you're right to raise it. But it's also why the First Nations Information Governance Centre's OCAP principles — Ownership, Control, Access, Possession — are now being written into funding agreements as binding requirements, not optional guidelines. Since the updated Tri-Council Policy Statement took effect in 2023, all federally funded research involving Indigenous cultural materials must include community data ownership clauses and technical transfer plans. The UBC project specifically requires that participating communities receive full local copies of all recordings in open formats, plus the training to maintain them independently. It's not perfect, but the governance frameworks have materially shifted.

**CASEY:** Governance frameworks on paper are one thing. Technical capacity on the ground is another. Running your own digital archive requires server maintenance, backup protocols, cybersecurity updates, format migrations as technology evolves. The National Film Board spent $4.7 million between 2015 and 2022 recovering archival materials trapped in obsolete digital formats — Betacam SP tapes, legacy QuickTime codecs, deteriorating optical discs. If the NFB struggled with format obsolescence, what chance does a volunteer-run community museum have?

**RILEY:** Okay, but you're comparing a massive institutional archive with decades of accumulated technical debt to communities starting fresh with modern open standards. That's not quite apples to apples. Cache Creek's community museum moved their entire collection to a self-hosted platform last year using Omeka S — free, open-source, specifically designed for cultural heritage collections. Local volunteers with IT backgrounds handle maintenance, and their annual technology costs dropped from $3,600 in subscription fees to under $400 for hosting. They have complete control over access permissions. It's not a billion-dollar operation, but it works.

**CASEY:** Cache Creek sits on the Trans-Canada Highway with decent internet infrastructure and happens to have residents with IT skills. That's a best-case scenario, not a template. You try uploading a single hour of uncompressed video from Anahim Lake on a 5 Mbps DSL connection — you'd be waiting the better part of a day. And when I say "IT-skilled volunteers," I mean two or three people whose availability depends entirely on their day jobs and personal circumstances. One person moves away and the whole project stalls.

**RILEY:** The connectivity piece is genuinely changing, though. Starlink's coverage map as of January 2026 shows service available to 94 percent of rural BC, with median latency under 40 milliseconds and download speeds between 50 and 200 megabits per second — that's sufficient for real-time collaborative editing and live streaming cultural events. The cost is still a barrier at $140 monthly, but Ashcroft's broadband co-op negotiated bulk Starlink rates that brought individual household costs down to $67 per month. Six other CARE-ih-boo communities are exploring similar cooperative purchasing arrangements.

**CASEY:** And now we've made irreplaceable cultural materials dependent on a private satellite constellation controlled by one of the most unpredictable executives on the planet. Starlink has already raised prices three times since 2022. They deprioritized Canadian rural customers during peak U.S. demand periods in late 2024 — speeds in parts of Northern BC dropped below 10 megabits for weeks. We're talking about preserving cultural heritage that needs to last generations, and we're building it on infrastructure that could be repriced, throttled, or abandoned based on one company's quarterly earnings call.

**RILEY:** Which is exactly why hybrid approaches make sense. Communities use satellite broadband for day-to-day cultural work — uploading content, live streaming events, collaborative projects — while maintaining local backup systems on community-owned hardware for critical preservation. The beauty of digital formats is redundancy. You can store copies on a local server, a regional archive like the BC Archives' community partnership program, and encrypted cloud backup simultaneously. Unlike a physical artifact that can be lost in a single wildfire — which is not a hypothetical concern in the CARE-ih-boo — digital cultural materials survive through distribution.

**CASEY:** Redundancy assumes someone is actively managing all those copies and keeping them synchronized. But let me shift to something that bothers me even more than the infrastructure question — content moderation. This is where digital storytelling gets genuinely treacherous for rural and Indigenous communities. Meta's automated moderation systems flagged and removed videos of Wet'suwet'en ceremony during the Coastal GasLink protests in 2020. Facebook has repeatedly taken down images of traditional hunting practices under its animal cruelty policies. A Haida elder's account was suspended in 2023 for sharing historical photographs that the algorithm classified as violent content. These aren't edge cases. They reveal a fundamental mismatch between Silicon Valley content policies and Indigenous cultural expression.

**RILEY:** You'll get zero argument from me on platform moderation failures — that's a genuine problem. But it's also accelerating something I think is ultimately healthy: communities moving toward platform independence. Tribal Hubs, the Indigenous-led social network that launched in 2024, was designed specifically to understand cultural contexts that mainstream algorithms miss. They've grown to over 40,000 users across North America in eighteen months, with content moderation handled by Indigenous community moderators rather than automated systems. Meanwhile, the Maskwacis Cree in Alberta built their own community media platform using open-source Mastodon software — it costs them about $200 a month to operate and they control every moderation decision.

**CASEY:** Platform independence sounds ideal until you run into network effects. If your community's stories only reach people already on Tribal Hubs, you're essentially narrating into an echo chamber. The Tumbler Ridge vigil got global attention because it spread across mainstream social media, not because it was posted to a niche platform. Reach matters — especially for communities trying to build broader understanding and solidarity.

**RILEY:** But that global reach comes bundled with exactly the surveillance and algorithmic distortion you just finished warning me about. Maybe the goal shouldn't always be maximum visibility. Maybe it should be appropriate visibility — communities controlling which stories go wide and which stay within trusted networks. Tribal Hubs is developing ActivityPub federation, the same protocol that powers Mastodon, which lets communities maintain their own content standards while selectively sharing with broader networks when they choose to. It's not all-or-nothing.

**CASEY:** That's a more nuanced framing than "just build your own platform," and I'll give you that. But I want to push on the economic question, because cultural storytelling doesn't sustain itself on good intentions alone. Are these digital tools actually generating income for rural artists and storytellers, or are we just giving people new ways to work for free?

**RILEY:** The evidence is mixed but trending positive. Stocksy United, the photographer-owned cooperative based in Victoria, has distributed over $28 million to member-owners since launching in 2013. Rural and small-town creators make up roughly 30 percent of their membership, and they earn royalties of 50 to 75 percent per image — compared to the 15 to 25 percent that Getty or Shutterstock typically pay. That cooperative ownership model is being adapted for other creative sectors. The Indigenous Art Collective in Saskatchewan launched a similar platform for digital art sales in 2024 and reported $1.2 million in first-year transactions with 80 percent going directly to artists.

**CASEY:** Those are real numbers, and I won't dismiss them. But Stocksy requires professional-grade work, technical editing skills, and an understanding of digital marketing. The Saskatchewan collective has a curatorial selection process. These aren't open doors — they're merit-based platforms that serve creators who already have significant skills and equipment. For a beadwork artist in Nazko or a fiddler in Likely who's never edited a video, the gap between "digital tools exist" and "I can earn a living from this" remains enormous.

**RILEY:** Fair enough, but the tools are also getting radically more accessible. Smartphone cameras now shoot 4K video that meets broadcast standards — the iPhone 15 and Samsung Galaxy S24 both shoot in LOG colour profiles that professional colourists use. DaVinci Resolve, which is Hollywood-grade editing software, is completely free for its base version. A drum-maker in Williams Lake, Earl Phillips, started documenting his process on TikTok in early 2025 with nothing but his phone and a ring light. He now has a six-month waiting list and ships drums internationally. His material costs didn't change — his audience just expanded by several orders of magnitude.

**CASEY:** I love that story, but one person going viral on TikTok is an anecdote, not an economic development strategy. TikTok's algorithm is famously opaque and unpredictable — creators report wild swings in visibility from one week to the next. The platform takes up to 50 percent of creator fund earnings in some tiers. And viral attention can be genuinely destabilizing for rural practitioners. A ceramicist in New Mexico, Eric Rempe, talked publicly in 2024 about how a viral TikTok video generated 12,000 orders overnight for a one-person pottery studio — he spent six months fulfilling backorders and nearly quit the craft entirely. We're potentially setting people up for a kind of success they're completely unprepared for.

**RILEY:** That's why I think the more sustainable path is direct-to-audience subscription models rather than algorithmic platforms. Substack, Patreon, Ko-fi — these let creators build reliable income from smaller dedicated audiences instead of chasing virality. A traditional storyteller with 200 monthly subscribers at $5 each earns $12,000 a year — modest, but predictable, and without surrendering creative control to platform algorithms. Tanya Tagaq, the Inuk throat singer, uses Patreon to share recordings and cultural commentary with about 1,500 subscribers, generating an estimated $50,000 to $90,000 annually outside the traditional music industry gatekeepers.

**CASEY:** Tagaq is an internationally recognized artist with a Polaris Prize. She brought an existing audience to Patreon. That's fundamentally different from asking a first-generation digital creator in a community of 300 people to build a subscriber base from zero. And subscription models still assume your audience has disposable income. Median household income in the CARE-ih-boo Regional District was around $67,000 in the 2021 census — below the provincial median. Are local communities realistically able to financially sustain their own digital cultural content?

**RILEY:** That's where diaspora networks change the equation. Rural communities have cultural connections that extend far beyond their geographic boundaries. The rancher-in-Cuba story from the 100 Mile Free Press resonates with rural people globally who recognize that experience of agricultural life and cross-cultural encounter. Digital platforms let storytellers reach audiences who share cultural affinity without sharing a postal code. A 2024 study from the Rural Policy Learning Commons found that rural creative enterprises with active online presences drew an average of 73 percent of their revenue from customers outside their home region. The audience isn't just local — it's the scattered diaspora of people who identify with rural life.

**CASEY:** That's a genuinely interesting data point, and I'll concede that diaspora economics complicate my "who's paying for this" argument. But I keep coming back to the participation gap within communities themselves. The Canadian Internet Registration Authority's 2025 survey found that 29 percent of rural Canadians over 65 still don't use the internet at all, and another 22 percent describe themselves as "not confident" online. Those are often the same people who hold the deepest cultural knowledge — the elders, the tradition-keepers. If digital storytelling becomes the dominant mode of cultural transmission, we risk creating a two-tier system where the people with the most to share are the least able to participate.

**RILEY:** Which is exactly why programs like CARE-ih-boo Chill-KOH-tin Partners for Literacy matter so much. Their most recent annual report shows that 78 percent of their digital skills training participants are over 50, and program completion rates exceed 85 percent. Community members want to participate — they just need accessible entry points and patient support. And intergenerational digital projects, where youth handle the technical side while elders provide the cultural knowledge, are producing some of the most compelling work I've seen. The Xeni Gwet'in youth media project pairs teenagers with elders to produce short documentaries about traditional land use — the kids learn cultural practices, the elders see their knowledge preserved in formats their grandchildren will actually engage with.

**CASEY:** I like intergenerational models — they keep technology in its proper place as a tool serving human relationships rather than replacing them. But those projects still require coordination, funding, and institutional support. The Xeni Gwet'in project is administered through the Sill-KOH-tin National Government with dedicated staff. When we scale down to communities without that institutional infrastructure, who's organizing the workshops, maintaining the equipment, managing the archives? I keep hearing "volunteers" as the answer, and volunteer burnout is the single biggest threat to rural community programs of any kind.

**RILEY:** I won't pretend volunteer sustainability isn't a challenge. But I'd push back on the framing that digital cultural work is always an additional burden. In many cases, it's a more efficient version of work communities are already doing. Recording an elder's story on a smartphone during a kitchen visit that was happening anyway isn't extra labour — it's capturing something that would otherwise be lost when that person passes. The Stó:lō Nation's "Kitchen Table Stories" project, which launched in 2023, specifically designed their approach around this insight — no studios, no formal interview settings, just smartphones and cultural moments that were already occurring. They've collected over 600 recordings with minimal additional time investment from participants.

**CASEY:** That's a thoughtful design approach, and I appreciate that it doesn't try to turn grandmothers into content creators. But it still requires someone to organize, tag, store, and maintain those 600 recordings. Somewhere between the kitchen table and the digital archive, there's a person doing unglamorous technical work.

**RILEY:** True. And honestly, that's one of the strongest arguments for regional shared services — a model where multiple communities pool resources to employ a shared digital archivist or cultural technology coordinator. The Columbia Basin Trust funds exactly this kind of position for communities in the Kootenays, and the CARE-ih-boo Regional District could explore something similar. One skilled person serving five or six communities is more sustainable than each community trying to develop that expertise independently.

**CASEY:** Now that's a structural solution I can actually get behind — it addresses the capacity problem without pretending technology will magically solve itself. Though I'd note the Columbia Basin Trust has an endowment of over $500 million, which gives them a funding stability most regional bodies can only dream about. The CARE-ih-boo doesn't have an equivalent financial backstop.

**RILEY:** No, but the Northern Development Initiative Trust covers this region and has funded digital infrastructure projects before — they allocated $2.3 million to connectivity and digital capacity projects across Northern BC in their 2024-2025 funding cycle. It's not the Columbia Basin Trust's endowment, but it's not nothing either. And the federal government's Community Services Recovery Fund has a digital transformation stream that several BC communities have accessed for cultural projects.

**CASEY:** I think where I land on this, Riley, is that the tools and the governance frameworks are genuinely improving — I'll give you that. The OCAP principles being written into funding agreements, cooperative ownership models, federation protocols for platform independence — those represent real structural progress. But I remain unconvinced that the infrastructure, funding, and human capacity are keeping pace with the ambition. We're asking the most under-resourced communities to execute some of the most complex cultural preservation work imaginable, and I think we owe them more honesty about how hard that is rather than leading with success stories.

**RILEY:** And I think we owe them more credit for what they're already accomplishing despite those constraints. The Xeni Gwet'in project, the Kitchen Table Stories model, Cache Creek's museum, the Williams Lake drum-maker — these aren't theoretical possibilities. They're things that are happening right now, in communities with real limitations, because people decided their stories were worth preserving in whatever format was available. Perfection shouldn't be the enemy of preservation. But you're right that sustainable funding and shared technical capacity need to catch up. The stories won't wait for the infrastructure to be perfect, but the infrastructure does need to keep closing the gap.

**CASEY:** Fair enough. I suppose my role is to keep pointing at the gap while you keep pointing at the bridge.

**RILEY:** Somebody has to build it. We'd love to hear how your community is navigating digital storytelling — the successes and the frustrations. Send us an email at feedback at care-ih-boo signals dot c-a.

**CASEY:** Thanks for joining us today. Have a great start to your week.
