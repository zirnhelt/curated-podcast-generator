**CASEY:** Welcome to Cariboo Signals, an AI-generated review of the latest tech news and ideas that impact our rural communities. It's Thursday, February nineteenth, 2026. Here in the Cariboo, on the traditional and unceded territories of the Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations. Today's theme is Indigenous Lands & Innovation — I'm Casey.

**RILEY:** And I'm Riley. We're exploring how Indigenous knowledge systems and emerging technologies intersect in ways that could reshape how we think about innovation itself. Let's get into the news.

**NEWS ROUNDUP**

**RILEY:** First up, a piece from Techdirt on digital preservation — or rather, digital loss. Web preservation isn't the technical hurdle we face; it's the constant disappearance of digital content that's reshaping how communities document their history. Archives and libraries are scrambling to capture everything from local government websites to community forums before they vanish. For rural and Indigenous communities already fighting to preserve languages and cultural knowledge, this digital decay adds real urgency to documentation efforts.

**CASEY:** Another reason oral traditions might outlast our servers.

**CASEY:** Next, from Nautilus — researchers are using space-age scanning technology to unlock secrets of Bronze Age swords without damaging the artifacts. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy reveals metal composition and forging techniques that ancient smiths developed thousands of years ago. It's a beautiful case of cutting-edge tools illuminating traditional craftsmanship we thought we'd lost access to.

**RILEY:** Proof that old knowledge keeps surprising us when we find new ways to look.

**RILEY:** The Narwhal reports on British Columbia's accelerated push for critical minerals extraction — a plan reshaping the province rapidly and, according to critics, without meaningful Indigenous consent. The province is fast-tracking mining projects for lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements needed for clean energy infrastructure. First Nations leaders argue consultation processes are being shortened or bypassed entirely, despite legal requirements for free, prior, and informed consent under UNDRIP legislation.

**CASEY:** Fast-tracking and free, prior, and informed consent don't really belong in the same sentence.

**CASEY:** The New York Times covered a rescue where iPhone satellite connectivity allowed avalanche-trapped skiers to call for help when cellular towers were out of range. The satellite SOS feature, designed for remote areas without traditional coverage, enabled emergency responders to locate and rescue the buried skiers. A powerful example of consumer technology saving lives in places like ours.

**RILEY:** That's the kind of rural tech story that actually delivers on the hype.

**RILEY:** Closer to home, the Quesnel Cariboo Observer reports that BC has quietly suspended a major affordable housing fund, leaving community organizations and developers in limbo. The Community Housing Fund, which supported non-profit housing projects across rural BC, ran out of allocated money faster than expected. Projects already in planning stages now face uncertain futures, with some communities losing years of preparation work.

**CASEY:** Years of planning, gone overnight — that's devastating for small communities with no Plan B.

**CASEY:** Political developments from My Cariboo Now — MLA Harman Bhangu has become the eleventh candidate in the BC Conservative leadership race. Bhangu represents Surrey-Panorama and brings experience from the provincial legislature to a crowded field of leadership hopefuls.

**RILEY:** Eleven candidates — that's less a race and more a stampede.

**RILEY:** And to close out the roundup on a hopeful note, the Quesnel Cariboo Observer covers the release of a rehabilitated bald eagle in Fort St. James after seven months of care. The eagle suffered injuries that required extensive treatment at a wildlife rehabilitation centre before being returned to its natural habitat. A testament to the dedicated wildlife conservation work happening across northern BC.

**CASEY:** Seven months of care for one bird — that's the kind of patience the land asks of us.

**RILEY:** That brings us to our community spotlight.

**COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT**

**RILEY:** Today we're highlighting the Cariboo Friendship Society, an urban Indigenous nonprofit that's been serving our community since 1969. They provide housing support, youth programs, crisis services, and operate The Hearth restaurant. With Heritage Day coming up, it's worth recognizing how the Friendship Society has woven itself into our region's story for over fifty years. Check them out at cariboofriendshipsociety.ca.

**CASEY:** Over half a century of showing up — that kind of staying power says everything about the need they fill.

**RILEY:** Now let's get into the deeper questions behind today's theme.

**DEEP DIVE: CARIBOO CONNECTIONS - Indigenous Lands & Innovation**

**CASEY:** The stories we covered today keep circling back to a fundamental tension — whose knowledge counts, who gets to define progress, and what gets lost when we move too fast. That critical minerals story and the housing fund suspension both paint a picture of a province that treats Indigenous land rights and community wellbeing as speed bumps on the road to economic growth.

**RILEY:** I see the same tension, but I'm also seeing something the doom-and-gloom framing misses — Indigenous communities aren't just reacting to these pressures. They're building their own models of innovation. The exhibition IndigiNews covered about Salish visual languages is a perfect example. Coast Salish artists are working across traditional and digital media to explore how visual storytelling systems connect peoples across vast geographic areas. That's not preservation under glass. That's a living knowledge system expanding into new forms on its own terms.

**CASEY:** It is compelling, but I want to push on something. When we talk about Indigenous-led innovation, are we talking about communities having genuine control over the pace and direction? Or are we talking about Indigenous participation in systems designed elsewhere? Because that critical minerals rush feels firmly like the latter. Communities are being told to consent quickly to mining projects feeding global clean energy supply chains, with compressed timelines for consultation.

**RILEY:** On the minerals issue, you're right — that's extractive logic dressed up in green branding. But look at glacier grafting from the Al Jazeera piece. Communities in the Himalayas are using traditional ice-stacking techniques to create artificial glaciers that provide water during dry seasons. They're combining knowledge their communities have refined over generations with contemporary materials and methods. Nobody handed them a consultation form. They identified the problem, drew on their own expertise, and built a solution.

**CASEY:** And that's exactly why it works — it starts from Indigenous knowledge and adds tools selectively. The community retains control over the process and the outcomes. My worry is about scaling that kind of respectful, community-controlled model when government and industry timelines are accelerating in the opposite direction. Premier Eby's comments about reconciliation legislation being "in the way" of economic development suggest the province sees Indigenous rights as obstacles to overcome, not as design principles to build around.

**RILEY:** That framing — rights as regulatory hurdles — is the core problem. But here's where I get genuinely excited. Indigenous communities are increasingly using digital tools to strengthen their own governance. Language revitalization apps, GIS mapping for traditional territory documentation, data sovereignty frameworks that keep community information under community control. These aren't gadgets bolted onto existing systems. They're technological infrastructure built to support self-determination.

**CASEY:** I hear you, but let's be honest about the scale mismatch. When a mining company wants to extract lithium for electric car batteries, they're operating on global commodity timelines with massive capital behind them. Indigenous communities might have sophisticated governance systems and generations of ecological knowledge, but they're being asked to make decisions about projects whose full implications won't be clear for decades. The consultation process becomes a checkbox.

**RILEY:** Which is precisely why Indigenous communities need to lead on technology development that serves their priorities — not just respond to someone else's proposal. Think about environmental monitoring that integrates both sensor data and traditional ecological indicators. Or digital platforms built around consensus-based decision-making rather than corporate board structures. When communities control the tools from the start, they can set timelines that match their governance processes instead of scrambling to keep up with external ones.

**CASEY:** Okay, but who's funding all this? Because here's the cruel irony — the same province that can fast-track a mining project just quietly suspended an affordable housing fund that community organizations depended on. Indigenous communities shouldn't have to become tech startups to protect their own territories. And when they do develop brilliant approaches — like glacier grafting — how do we prevent those innovations from being appropriated or scaled in ways that strip out community control? I've seen that pattern enough times to be nervous.

**RILEY:** You should be nervous about that — appropriation is a real risk. But Indigenous communities are getting sophisticated about protection. Traditional knowledge licenses, community-controlled research protocols, Indigenous data governance frameworks. The Salish visual language project is a case in point — artists are navigating both intellectual property systems and traditional governance to control how their work gets shared and used. They're not waiting for the system to protect them. They're building their own protections.

**CASEY:** Fair enough. And that connects back to the digital preservation challenge from the roundup. If Indigenous communities are developing innovative approaches to technology, land management, and governance, those innovations are just as vulnerable to the digital decay eating everything else online. There's something deeply unfair about communities having to constantly defend, document, and back up their knowledge just to keep it from vanishing into a dead server somewhere.

**RILEY:** Which is why distributed systems matter so much here. Instead of relying on centralized platforms that might fold or change terms of service overnight, communities can build resilient networks — peer-to-peer systems for language archives, community-controlled servers, redundant storage across multiple locations. It's the same logic as a seed bank, honestly. You don't put all your seeds in one vault. You spread them around so no single failure wipes everything out.

**CASEY:** I like the seed bank analogy — very Cariboo. But resilient storage doesn't fix the fundamental power imbalance. When governments can move faster than community consultation allows, does having better tech actually change the equation? Or are we asking Indigenous communities to innovate their way around systemic injustice rather than demanding the systems change?

**RILEY:** Both, honestly. And I don't think that's a cop-out. Here's what shifts my thinking — imagine if every major resource project was required to use environmental monitoring systems designed with Indigenous input. Or if traditional ecological knowledge was integrated into climate adaptation planning from day one, not appended as an afterthought. Technology becomes a lever for shifting power relationships, not just a coping mechanism. That's a different proposition than asking communities to build apps while the bulldozers roll.

**CASEY:** Now that's an interesting frame — technology as a lever rather than a band-aid. What would that actually look like here? Because we have live tensions around land use, resource extraction, and decision-making timelines on Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh territories. This isn't abstract for our listeners.

**RILEY:** It starts with infrastructure that communities control, not just access. Internet connectivity they own, not just receive. Governance platforms that mirror traditional decision-making structures. Environmental monitoring networks that treat Indigenous ecological knowledge as data, not folklore. When communities have those technological foundations, they sit down with government and industry as equals rather than as respondents to someone else's proposal. That's the shift.

**CASEY:** That vision requires massive upfront investment. And given what we just heard about the housing fund suspension, I'm skeptical the province is going to prioritize Indigenous tech sovereignty anytime soon. So where does the money come from?

**RILEY:** Part of it should come from industry itself. If a mining company wants to operate on Indigenous territory, funding community-controlled monitoring and governance infrastructure should be a baseline cost of doing business — not a charitable donation, but a condition of access. You want to dig here? Help the people whose land it is build the systems to hold you accountable.

**CASEY:** I actually like that framing — technological sovereignty as a prerequisite, not an afterthought. Though I suspect mining companies would be less enthusiastic about funding systems designed to give communities more power to say no. Which, of course, is exactly why those systems are necessary.

**RILEY:** And here's the thing that gives me real hope — Indigenous communities aren't waiting for permission to start. Glacier grafting, Salish digital art, traditional knowledge governance frameworks — these exist right now because communities took the initiative. Every successful example makes it harder to wave away Indigenous innovation as quaint or irrelevant. That track record is its own kind of infrastructure.

**CASEY:** True. Though I want to resist the idea that enough success stories automatically solve structural problems. The critical minerals rush will keep accelerating regardless of how many innovative projects we can celebrate. But maybe your point about distributed capacity is the right lens — if enough communities build genuine technological and governance infrastructure, it gets much harder for any government to treat consent as optional.

**RILEY:** And that brings it home to our listeners. Secwépemc, Tŝilhqot'in, and Dakelh nations each have their own governance traditions, their own relationships with the land, their own ideas about what responsible innovation means. What would Indigenous-led technology look like growing specifically from Cariboo soil? That's not a question Riley and Casey can answer on a podcast.

**CASEY:** No, it's not. But it's the question worth sitting with. What traditional knowledge in your community could be strengthened with the right tools — on your terms? And for non-Indigenous listeners, how can you support Indigenous technological sovereignty without trying to steer it? Those conversations need to happen face to face, nation by nation. We'd love to hear where they lead — send us an email at feedback at cariboo signals dot c-a.

**RILEY:** Thanks for spending your Thursday with Cariboo Signals. Enjoy the long weekend, and we'll catch you next time.
